A golem follows verbal orders from its maker; the maker may instruct it to obey others.  Clay Golem Clay is the default material for golems; it is easily molded, both physically and supernaturally. Golem enchanters often go on to work with more difficult materials – stone, plastic, flesh – but if a golem is needed in a hurry, most enchanters return to clay.

Features: Neither has nor spends Fatigue Points. Skills: 10 points of skills appropriate to the golem's intended function [10].  Golems make excellent warriors; they never grow tired, and are immune to stunning, pain, and the like.  It understands only one language (which must be spoken by the caster). It takes no initiative, and ignores any situation for which it has been given no orders. However, it never forgets anything it sees or is told. Golems do not heal on their own, and are destroyed if reduced to -HP. They may be repaired with Healing spells (except Resurrection) if cast by the golem's creator. There is no other way to repair a golem. To create a golem, the creator must make its body – doing all the work himself – then animate it with this spell. Once animated, a golem lasts until reduced to 0 HP or until its creator commands it to cease functioning. No concentration or maintenance is required to control a golem. A basic clay golem (see box) costs 250 energy to enchant. A more powerful golem costs an additional 2 energy for every extra character point of abilities added to the golem. In most cases, additional abilities should be restricted to extra ST, HP, and DR (a rule of thumb: 20 points of energy buys 1 ST, 5 HP, or 2 DR); however, GMs may allow more sweeping changes to the basic golem if they feel comfortable doing so. More powerful golems may require more durable (and more costly) materials, adding to the cost and time required to create the golem's body.

An object in a closed blocker container retains the impressions it had when the container was shut. If removed, handled briefly, and replaced, the object will acquire a very faint impression of the handler, but it won't be enough for a Seeker spell unless the handler does so once a day for decades. It is possible for an object in a blocker container still to be useful; for example, a book open to an important page, and stored in a glass container, can still be read! At sufficiently advanced tech levels, a 'waldo' or remote-manipulation box can be enchanted, allowing handling of the object without opening the box. In some settings, these containers can also be used to preserve evidence. If an object is owned for one person for a long time, and then transferred to a new owner, the original owner's impressions may wear off.

The process requires something that is personally relevant to the subject; use the modifiers listed under Malefice. The caster's spell roll is determined by the lower of his skills with this spell and the specific spell being placed on the subject. If the caster has assistants, their skills with both spells must be 15 or greater, but the roll is based on the caster's skill. Possible ensorcelments include quite a few Body or Mind Control spells and others such as Shapeshift Other, Flesh to Stone, the various 'Body of' spells, Walk on Air, the various 'Resist' spells, Hide, Invisibility, the various 'Vision' spells and Plant Form Other. In all cases, it must be a maintainable Regular spell. When the spell is cast, the subject gets a resistance roll if the object spell allows one; distance is not a factor. Remove Curse is effective against any ensorcelment. The cost of the enchantment can be reduced if the caster includes an 'escape clause' – a particular action or condition that will break the spell. Examples include speaking a magic word, being kissed as a gesture of true love, abstaining from speech for three years, and so on. The value of the energy reduction depends on just how difficult the condition will be to meet – and the 'escape clause' must be at least possible to be worth any reduction. The 'discount' can be anything from 10% (for truly difficult or unlikely conditions) to 90% (for something that the subject could easily and automatically do, and easily discover).",

If the roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it is failed, the stone is simply wasted. If the stone is crushed without the requisite second of concentration, it is likewise wasted. The spell's energy is included in the enchantment; none is required of the user, who also may not opt to supply any power to maintain the spell. Likewise, he may not cancel the spell once cast, although the creator of the stone may specify a shorter duration than ordinary and may also invest extra energy into the enchantment so that the spell will maintain itself. A person may use only one spell stone per second. A spell stone must be made from a jewel worth $10¥P2 + $40¥P, where P is the maximum energy of the spell that may be contained. Any spell except a Blocking or Enchantment spell may be stored in a spell stone. Limiting Enchantments may be put on the stone. If the spell stored in the stone requires that the caster know another spell (Counterspell, for instance), that other spell must be specified at creation time. It is thus possible to create a spell stone that will counter one specific spell, but it is impossible to create a generic Counterspell spell stone. It is also possible to create spell stones which, when crushed, do not cast the spell for the user, but on him!

If the weapon gets a critical miss, or is struck by a critical hit, it is 'stunned' and out of the fight (unless it breaks, in which case it is destroyed). If its owner is killed, it falls to the floor – but if he is merely knocked unconscious, it continues to attack the closest foe. A dancing weapon can also be trapped in a net or bag (same basic roll as to hit it, but the GM can give bonuses or penalties depending on the cleverness of the method used). The weapon can also be left with orders to attack anyone who approaches within a certain distance; a Link can be used to activate it only if a certain event takes place. Once activated, if its owner is not around, it attacks anyone in range – closest first, unless the Link had other instructions. A dancing weapon cannot change owners while animated; grasping the handle of a dancing weapon is not enough to make it change sides.",

  "spell-weapon-spirit-type": "Enchantment",
  "spell-weapon-spirit-description": "Transfers the personality and some of the intelligence of a recently deceased being (humanoid or not – dogs are popular subjects) to a weapon, usually a sword. The enchantment is at -1 for each full day that elapsed between the donor's death and the beginning of the enchantment. Most of the body must be present at the beginning of the enchantment, but may disposed of after it commences. The enchanter can pass on as little or as much of the donor's IQ as he wishes to the weapon, as well as some of the donor's skills, advantages, and disadvantages. The weapon has no memory of its former existence. Although it has no sensory organs, it possesses sight and hearing (Per 10). Quirks (or disadvantages reduced to quirk level) are sometimes transferred from the donor to the weapon, whether the enchanter wants them or not (this is why dogs are popular; their personalities tend to make biddable but effective weapons). The weapon can communicate with its wielder through an extremely basic empathy. When the wielder takes a course of action the weapon approves of, he gets a 'good feeling,' and if he takes one the weapon disapproves of, he gets an equivalent 'bad feeling.' The weapon may be enchanted with the Voices spell to give it a voice. Various Communication and Empathy enchantments may be added to the weapon to enhance the communication. Each time it gets a new wielder, the weapon must make a single reaction roll, which sets the tone for its relationship with the wielder from that point on. On a very good reaction, the weapon will do literally anything for its wielder; on a very bad one, it refuses to communicate or cooperate in any way. The GM should record the result; the weapon cannot be forced to roll a new reaction by being passed back and forth between wielders!",

Each missile exists for one minute after being removed from the container; then it vanishes (or, if picked up by anyone but the Cornucopia's owner, it vanishes immediately). Therefore, this spell cannot be used to make a single quiver supply enough arrows for an army! It cannot be cast on a weapon.

  "spell-spell-arrow-type": "Enchantment",
  "spell-spell-arrow-description": "Similar to a Spell Stone, a spell arrow stores a spell until it is fired. The archer need not be a mage. The arrow's user must concentrate for the appropriate time to cast to 'arm' the spell. This cannot be simultaneous with aiming the bow, and isn't reduced by high skill (but see Speed Skill Arrow, below). An unused spell arrow disarms after 1 minute. The spell acti- vates when the arrow hits a solid object; roll against the effective skill of the arrow's enchanter. If the roll is suc- cessful, the spell is cast. If it is a nor- mal failure, the spell is simply wasted. Critical failures go to the Critical Spell Failure Table (p. 7). If the arrow is fired without the required concentration, the spell is wasted, but the arrow still does normal damage. The spell's energy is included in the enchantment. The archer need not (and cannot) provide any to cast the spell or maintain it. Similarly, the archer may not cancel the spell once cast, though the enchanter may speci- fy a shorter duration than normal, and may also invest extra energy so the spell will maintain itself. The head of a spell arrow must contain a jewel worth $10¥P2 + $40¥P, where P is the maximum energy of the contained spell. The gem is destroyed when the spell activates. (The rest of the arrow may be recoverable, but is now nonmagical.) Any spell that can be enchanted into a magic item can be placed in a spell arrow, except for Blocking spells, Enchantment spells, Melee spells, or spells whose magic item description specifies 'must touch.' Note that some permissible spells are pointless (e.g., Beast-Soother), since the archer must hit the target with an arrow any- way. Enchantments may be placed on the arrow itself normally, including limiting enchantments. The only decision the archer can make is what he's aiming at. If the spell requires a subject, whatever the arrow hits is the subject. (If it is not a legal subject – e.g., a wooden wall for Strike Blind – the spell is wasted.) What constitutes a 'solid object' may require the GM's judgment (for exam- ple, drops of rain are not enough to trigger the spell). If it is an Area spell, the point of impact is the center of the area. If it is a Missile spell, the effect is as if the missile hit the target, in addi- tion to the arrow (the missile does not launch itself from the point of impact). If the spell creates an object, the object appears as close as possible to the point of impact. If the spell would normally affect both a subject and the caster (e.g., (Animal) Control) the archer is treated as the caster. If the spell requires a human target, the spell still works even if the arrow hits clothing instead of skin. The enchanter specifies everything else: duration, area, precise effect, etc. Analyze Magic can reveal what spell a spell arrow contains, how much energy was invested, and so on (one question per casting). Arrows intended for the consumer market are usually color-coded.",

If the owner is knocked out, the shield continues protecting him to the best of its abilities. If the owner dies, the shield falls to the ground. The shield can Block two different attacks per turn, regardless of its owner's actions (so the owner could parry any blow that got by the shield, for instance). The shield can be instructed to bash (p. B406), in which case its owner forfeits the shield's pro- tection until the beginning of his next turn (the shield will travel no more than two yards from the owner to bash). The shield can be attacked at a penalty of its DB-4. The shield's defense will be either a Block (using Shield/2) or a Dodge (using Speed); it does not get any DB bonus from itself. The shield could also be netted or bagged (standard to-hit roll). If the shield gets a critical miss or is struck by a critical hit, it is stunned and out of the fight until its owner grasps it and 'wakes it up' (a Ready maneu- ver). The shield loses its magic if destroyed; if penetrated by an impal- ing or piercing weapon, it loses one point each of Power, Shield skill, and Basic Speed.

  "spell-effigy-description": "A mage can enchant an effigy, a lifesize statue of himself, which attracts hostile magic directed at him to itself. Like Malefice, Effigy is a lasting spell, which continues until its Endurance is reduced to zero. Every time a spell attacks the effigy's maker, the effigy resists with its current Endurance, modified for the distance separating it from him (use the long-distance modifiers, p. 14). If the effigy succeeds, the spell affects it rather than its maker, The GM must decide what constitutes a 'hostile' spell; for instance, Deathtouch is, but Mind-Reading isn't. Redirected spells that have no effect on inanimate statues (such as Paralyze Limb or Death Vision) instead 'attack' the enchantment. The effigy then resists with its current Endurance. Every such successful attack reduces the effigy's Endurance by one; when the effigy's Endurance drops below 0, it ceases functioning. A critical failure by the effigy or a critical success by the attacking spell also breaks the enchantment, as does physical destruction. An enchanter may only have one effigy at any one time.",

The more 'distant' the target time is, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty (see Time modifiers, box). Unlike Teleport, there is no penalty to timeport to an 'unfamiliar' time; the GM may, however, decree that any timeport to the future bears an extra penalty (-2, perhaps). If this spell takes the caster to the future, it is the most likely of many possible futures. If he returns from that future and acts on the information gained, there is no guarantee that the future he visited will actually occur. Similarly, a caster who returns to the past, changes something, and then returns to his starting time might return to an alternate timeline. The amount of variation between the caster's 'home' timeline and the new one will depend on the GMs view of how 'tamper-resistant' the timestream is in his game world(s). This spell is dangerous – the penalties for a failed roll are the same as for Teleport, substituting time for space. Also as in Teleport, the caster can carry no more than Heavy encumbrance (objects and beings).

Planar Summons cannot be used on the plane for which it is intended. When the creature appears, the caster must immediately try to control it. Treat this as a Quick Contest between the caster's Planar Summons skill and the entity's Will. The caster is at +4 if he knows the creature's 'true name.' If the caster wins, he can give the creature a single command, which it must carry out. On completing this task – or after one hour in any event – the entity usually vanishes. However, some powerful entities can stay for as long as they wish ... If the caster ties or loses, the creature will react badly. An 'evil' being commits violence or vandalism, while a 'good' one is more likely to depart in a huff and put in a bad word with the caster's gods.

He is totally insubstantial and cannot affect anything or interact with his surroundings in any way (a blessing in disguise, since this also confers total physical immunity to whatever environment he is traversing). He cannot even cast spells, although he can maintain existing ones. He is likewise immune to magic that does not affect minds or spirits (which the caster is, until he returns to his body). The caster is imperceptible to ordinary senses; only magic (Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense Observation and similar spells) will detect his presence. There is a different spell for travel to each plane or dimension. Which spells exist, and the precise details of the dimensions they lead to, is up to the GM. The subject's senses are altered to correspond to the average plane dweller's; on a plane of perpetual gloom he would have Dark Vision, on the astral plane he would have his senses augmented as per Astral Vision, and on a dimension where all life forms sense only via sound he would have Scanning Sense (Sonar). Visiting very strange alternate planes can be hazardous to the mental health of an unsuspecting traveler ... The most common plane visited in most worlds is the astral, which coexists with the mundane universe and allows visitors to observe real-world places unseen (at least, unseen except by natives of the astral realm, if there are any). While traveling astrally, the caster moves at twice his full unencumbered Speed and may walk through walls, mountains, creatures ... He may also walk down into the bowels of the earth or up into the higher atmosphere. Astral Block (p. 159), Pentagram (p. 124) and the 'Utter' spells (p. 170) stop him, while Repel Spirits (p. 158) will resist his intrusion. If the spell ends before his spirit rejoins his body or if his body is harmed while his spirit is away, he must roll vs. HT, using the long-distance modifiers (p. 14), to stay alive!

Should the caster die alone in the area, the spell will never end! The caster and any objects caught in the area would simply seem to vanish from the time stream. As far as outside observers are con- cerned, the area 'ages' instantaneously (which may or may not be perceptible). One moment five ogres were attacking the party while their wizard cast a spell, and the next moment the ogres were dead, the party magically healed, and everybody was in a different position and drinking rum to celebrate. From the inside, the area is bounded by a wall (and covered by a ceiling) of utter blackness. Anyone or anything touching the edge of the area is immediately expelled from the area, back into normal time. This causes an automatic mental stun to anyone other than the caster. Missiles of any sort can be thrown blindly out of the area (see Shooting Blind, p. B389) but not into it. Note that, since all missiles fired out of the area will emerge at the same outside time, an archer could create an impressive burst of arrows by simply firing casually for a few subjective hours ... Spells involving the outside simply fail. Any spell requiring concentration and lying inside the area lapses immediately if its caster is left outside. Likewise, any inside spell whose maintenance comes due during the Time Out lapses unless its caster is also inside.  The 'flow' of mana into the Timed Out area is effectively nil. Powerstones won't recharge, enchantment is impossible, etc. Mages still recover lost energy (the physical consequences of manipulating mana go away regardless of the local mana supply), but GMs may decree that spells cost much more, or are impossible, within the timestopped area (since the power must be drawn entirely from the caster's personal life-force).

  "spell-initiative-description": "This spell can be cast on any creation or illusion the caster controls, giving it a semblance of intelligence in order to act on its own initiative. The subject is totally loyal to the caster, and obeys him (or anyone else the caster orders it to heed) to the best of its ability. The base cost of the spell is based on what knowledge the caster grants the subject. Creations start with their own DX and IQ as listed in the spell description. For the purposes of this spell, Illusions and Phantoms start with IQ 0 and DX 8. The subject's DX and IQ may be raised as high as the caster's. The subject may also be given the caster's skills – every skill granted is known at the same relative level as the caster. Illusions and creations with Initiative may use defaults on any skill. Once the spell is cast, the subject acts on its own until the spell expires. If the subject comes across a situation that confuses it, it attempts to return to the caster for clarification. Like Independence (p. 96), this spell does not count as a spell 'on,' and does not require separate maintenance.  Example: Lady Ann Goulding has created a magical servant to amuse her noble and decadent guests. She wishes it to circulate throughout the party, serving food, dancing with the noblewomen, and showing appropriate respect – without requiring constant supervision, so that she can enjoy herself. It begins with 9 in every attribute, but no skills (Lady Ann could have created a skilled servitor, but she has Create Servant-15 and can maintain an unskilled one indefinitely). To this base she adds 2 points of DX (bringing it up to her own DX of 11), and 2 points of IQ (well below her own IQ of 14) to make it wittier. This is a total attribute increase of 4, for a base cost of 2. Lady Ann then gives it two skills – Dancing and Savoir-Faire. She has Dancing-14 (DX+3), and since the servant has the same DX as she does, the servant will, too. The lady's knowledge of Savoir-Faire is considerable (skill 15, or IQ+1), but the servant is not as smart as she, and will only have it at its own IQ+1, for a net Savoir-Faire13. These two skills add 2 more to the base cost, for a total of 4. Since the servant is less than 1 yard in radius, a casting at base cost will suffice.",

The Link may also be triggered by the activation of a spell placed on the area after the Link, such as Watchdog, Delay or another Link. The caster pays the energy costs and makes the skill rolls for the Link spell and all linked spells at the time of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high skill. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11. The size of the area of the Link spell is determined at the time of casting. Any linked spells may go off anywhere within the Linked area; for instance, if a one-yard-radius Create Fire and oneyard-radius Glue spell were linked to a 20-yard-radius Link to catch intruders,  the first intruder to enter the Link's area would find himself in a zone of flaming glue, but subsequent intruders would be safe (from that Link, anyway). The size of the linked spells must be set at the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell either has no effect, or a weaker effect, depending on the spell. The GM's ruling on this is final. Only subjects within the Linked area are affected, unless the spell results in an effect that would not be bound to that area – summoning a demon, for example! The triggering event may occur outside of the area, however. The time to cast the linked spells is spent when initially set up. There is no delay when the Link is triggered – all linked spells are activated instantly. The linked spells do not count as a spell 'on' for any purpose. Every three Link spells on count as one spell on, rounding down. A mage cannot detect a Link simply by looking at it. The Mage Sight spell or the Detect Magic spell will reveal the Link, however. If the mage knows the Conceal Magic spell, the Link may be made harder to detect by magical means. Simply adding the Conceal Magic costs to the base cost of the Link spell accomplishes this effect. The mage must know Conceal Magic to use this option. If the subject of a linked spell is not present at the casting, and has Magic Resistance, refer to the original die roll to determine the results. If the original die roll of the linked spell is not recorded, reroll the spell for this purpose only. Blocking and missile spells cannot be Linked – other spells can. An 'instantaneous' spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires. A single Link can be made to activate a spell when the area is entered, and deactivate the spell when the area is left. This may continue until the linked spell expires. As an example, a mage may cast Link on Continual Light. If he then rolls seven days for the duration of the Continual Light spell (168 hours), he can have the Link set up to turn the Light on when he enters the room, and turn it off when he leaves. When 168 hours of light have been used, both spells expire. For instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes after activating the other spells. No maintenance of a Link is required, either for the Link itself, the linked spells, or any information spells cast on the Link to tell it when to trigger. Link may also be set in reverse, to stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell will last only while the caster maintains it, but the Link itself requires no maintenance. Link can also be used for Limiting Enchantments (see pp. 68-69).",

  "spell-converts-that-spell-to-function-as-a-description": "disappear. Unlike Delay or Link, a Reflexed spell is triggered by the will of the caster, not by an external event. This means that while Reverse Missiles may be Reflexed to activate if the caster sees someone shoot at him, it will not be triggered by a shot in the back. It is treated as an active defense, similar to Parry or Block for all practical purposes (except retreating does not add 3 to the roll). Casting a Reflexed spell will interrupt any spell the caster is concentrating on, and is handled like any other Blocking spell – see pp. 12-13. When Reflex is cast, the linked spell must be cast immediately after Reflex, by the same caster. Each casting of Reflex will only work on one spell – it is not possible to have multiple spells operate as one Blocking spell. The skill roll for Reflex is rolled at the time of casting, but the roll for the linked spell is not made until it is cast as a Blocking spell. The energy cost for Reflex is paid at the time of casting Reflex, but the energy for the Reflexed spell is not paid until it is cast, whether as an active defense or otherwise. The time to cast a Reflexed spell is spent immediately after the Reflex is cast, but the success roll and energy cost are handled later.  A Reflexed spell counts as one spell 'on' for spellcasting purposes – see p. 10. A Reflexed spell does not count as 'on' when making the roll to cast itself. Thus, if a mage has four Reflexed spells on, any other spell he casts is at -4, but when he casts one of the Reflexed spells, it is only at -3 for the other three Reflexed spells on.  Note that a mage may cast a Reflex on another person. The caster (not the subject) may activate it at any time, using long-distance modifiers. If the linked spell is cast on a subject other than the subject of the Reflex itself, the regular modifier for the distance to that subject is added to the longdistance modifier for the caster.  It is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed!  A Reflexed spell may be cast only once. It then disappears, and no longer counts as a spell on. The effects are immediate, and the duration is instantaneous, not the duration listed for the original spell. This means that it is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed! A Force Dome, for example, would stop one physical attack, then disappear – a fatiguing, but effective, defense! A Created Animal will appear, then disappear before it can make any action. (It might stop a missile during its brief existence, however. The GM may rule such an animal must be nearly equal in size to the target it is shielding.) Exceptions to this instantaneousresult rule are spells with permanent results, such as Major Healing – their effects are indeed permanent. Any person may carry any number of Reflexes. However, only one spell may be cast in any one turn. Remember also, that if a Reflexed spell is used as an active defense, no other active defense may be used against that attack, unless All-Out Defense is chosen. See p. B366. A Reflexed spell may be cast as a regular action – it does not have to be cast as a defense. It takes one second to cast, regardless of the time it would normally require to cast. All normal modifiers for distance and Magic Resistance are used when casting the Reflexed spell, if the subject of the Reflexed spell is distant from the person or object the Reflex itself is cast on.  Example: Felix gives Beast-Soother as a Reflexed spell to Rudolph. Felix then activates a Wizard Eye to keep tabs on Rudolph as he goes hunting. Rudolph meets a short-tempered wild boar, which Felix observes through the Wizard Eye. Rudolph cannot activate the spell. Fortunately, he does not have to! Felix activates Beast-Soother as Rudolph tries an Animal Handling roll to calm the boar. Rudolph has gone about two miles into the woods, so Felix is at -3 for long distance. The boar is 3 yards away from Rudolph, so Felix is at another -3 for the range to the subject of the Reflexed spell. He is also at -1 for having Wizard Eye on. Thus, Felix casts Beast-Soother at -7, and pays the energy for the spell at that time. Fortunately he has it at level 21, so he casts it for the maximum effect. The boar is indeed calmed, and Rudolph goes on his way while Felix rests. The Reflexed BeastSoother spell no longer exists. If Rudolph meets another animal, he's on his own, though Felix may still be observing any action with his Wizard Eye. Blocking spells and Missile spells cannot be Reflexed; other spells can be.",

It is under the command of the first person to step aboard it. If there are several beings already aboard when the spell is cast, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see who gets control; the caster (if aboard) gets a +5 bonus to this roll. If the pilot leaves the carpet, roll another quick contest of Will between the remaining passengers to see who gets control. The carpet's maximum Move is equal to the caster's effective skill, and it can handle 1 G turns without skill rolls being necessary (p. B466). Use the Piloting (Contragravity) skill (p. B214) to control the carpet. In general, a rider cannot fall from a flying carpet unless he jumps off deliberately or is knocked off by an obstacle (such as a tree branch) or attack; the carpet keeps its riders safely on board through a combination of magic and deft maneuvering. A flying carpet does not bank sharply, fold, or bend; the spell specifically provides a stable, level platform (which makes flying through narrow gaps rather hard). Any rider engaged in strenuous activity such as fighting must make a DX roll every turn to avoid falling off (the GM may modify this roll depending on the activity). In all other respects, treat anyone fighting from a flying carpet as being on the ground (ignore the special rules for flying combatants on p. B548). Characters aiming a missile weapon from a moving carpet can only take the Acc bonus; aiming for extra turns gives no further bonus. Of course, someone fighting from a flying broom or chair would be subject to the usual penalties for being seated (p. B547) Generous GMs may stipulate that, after the caster cancels the spell, the conveyance remains airborne for 2d+2 seconds, wobbling more with every passing moment.

The zombies regard the other members of the circle as his lieutenants; their orders are obeyed, but the master's orders take precedence.

He retains his personality, knowledge, IQ, skills, and spells, and all his mental advantages and disadvantages (including Magery), but gains the physical and supernatural traits of a lich, as determined by the GM. The more powerful that package, the higher the energy cost. After the GM determines the lich template (and hence, the energy cost), the mage casts this spell as with any other enchantment, but with himself as the subject. At the end of the enchanting, he rolls against skill. Any failure does 6d damage to the caster. A success prepares the wizard's body for the next step. To complete the transformation, the would-be lich must drink an alchemical elixir of Lichdom. The elixir of Lichdom is prepared like any other alchemical elixir (see p. 210); it requires $13,500 in materials and 50 weeks of brewing. It defaults to Alchemy-7. Anyone not currently under the effects of a Lich spell who imbibes an elixir of Lichdom is affected as if he had drunk an elixir of Death (p. 215). However, an elixir of Lichdom cannot be counteracted, even with an alchemical Antidote. The elixir of Lichdom is forbidden everywhere, and formularies for it are almost impossible to find; most liches are compelled to reinvent it from scratch. When a wizard under the Lich spell drinks a potion of Lichdom, he must roll vs. HT. If he succeeds, he dies, rising as a lich in 2d days. If he fails, he just dies. Luck, as well as the Bless and Wish spells, can influence this HT roll. This is also an Enchantment spell.  Lich 105 points Attribute Modifiers: ST-1 [-10]; DX+2 [40]; HT+2 [20].

Clothing vanishes, to reappear when you regain your form; large possessions fall to the ground, while small ones (up to bracelet or wand size) may remain imbedded in your plant form. The caster cannot move about, attack, etc., unless a plant with those abilities exists in the game world and he takes that form, or unless Animate Plant is cast on his plant form. A wizard in plant shape may cast no spells unless he knows them so well that he can cast them without speech or gesture! He may hear normally but may not see except to sense light and darkness. He may not speak. Injuries taken in plant form carry over proportionately. This means, for instance, that an arrow wound to a tree is a pinprick to a man; some GM flexibility is required here! Time spent in plant form automatically counts as 'rest' unless the plant is under attack. However, he must roll against IQ every hour that he stays in plant form. A failed roll temporarily reduces his IQ by 1. If IQ drops to 5, he is trapped in plant form, with a plant's IQ, until someone else frees him with Remove Curse.

There's an additional visibility penalty of -1 per 8 yards distance, applied to missile attacks and Vision rolls. The caster may elect to exclude any in the area from the effects of the spell, focusing the 'ire' of the wood on enemies. This spell may only be cast outdoors, in a forest. It won't work in the dead of winter, or in very sparse woods. Depending on the species of trees, the nuts may turn out to be edible.

Anyone failing the first Fright Check will be very reluctant to enter! Dangerous animals simply avoid the mist, but suffer normal effects if for some reason they must enter it. Those 'native' to the mist have a +1 to their defense rolls when attacked by interlopers, and interlopers have a -1 to their own defense rolls against 'natives.'
