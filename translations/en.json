  "skill-description-immovable-stance": "This skill allows you to anchor yourself to the ground by properly channeling your chi, using secret balancing techniques, etc. Make a skill roll whenever an attack (e.g., a shove or the Push skill, p. 216) would result in knockback or a fall.\nOn a success, you neither experience knockback nor fall down. On a failure, you are knocked back but still get the usual DX roll to avoid falling down. On a critical failure, you automatically suffer full knockback and you fall down.\nThis skill also helps against attacks with the Judo skill (p. 203). If you fail your active defense (or choose not to defend) against a Judo throw, your attacker must win a Quick Contest of Judo vs. your Immovable Stance skill, or his throw fails.",
  "skill-description-lockpicking": "This is the ability to open locks without the key or combination. Each attempt requires one minute. If you make the roll and open the lock, each point by which you succeeded shaves five seconds off the required time. (Safecracking and similar challenges can take more time, at the GM’s discretion.)\nNote that if the lock has a trap or alarm attached, you must make a separate Traps roll to circumvent it.",
  "skill-description-wrestling": "This skill represents training at grappling and pinning. Roll against the higher of DX or Wrestling to hit with a grapple, or to make or resist a takedown. Furthermore, if you know Wrestling at DX+1 level, add +1 to ST for the purpose of making or resisting any choke, grapple, neck snap, takedown, or pin, and whenever you attempt to break free. Add +2 to ST for Wrestling at DX+2 or better.\nWhen you defend with bare hands, Wrestling allows you to parry once per turn. You must use both hands. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. This parry is at -3 vs. weapons. For complete rules for parrying barehanded, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).",
  "skill-description-staff": "Pole weapons are long (usually wooden) shafts, often adorned with striking heads. All require two hands.\nAny long, balanced pole without a striking head. This skill makes good use of the staff’s extensive parrying surface when defending, giving +2 to your Parry score. Defaults: Polearm-4 or Spear-2.",
  "skill-description-detect-lies": "This is the ability to tell when someone is lying to you. It is not the same as Interrogation (p. 202); Detect Lies works in a casual or social situation. When you ask to use this skill, the GM rolls a Quick Contest of your Detect Lies skill vs. your subject’s IQ (or Fast-Talk or Acting skill). If you win, the GM tells you whether the subject is lying. If you lose, the GM may lie to you about whether you were lied to ... or just say, 'You can’t tell.'",
  "skill-modifiers-detect-lies": "+1 for Sensitive\n+3 for Empathy\n-3 for Low Empathy\n+4 if subject is Easy to Read",
  "skill-description-invisibility-art": "This is the fabled skill, often attributed to ninja and other martial-arts masters, of being able to stand in plain sight without being noticed. It requires one second of concentration to activate. After that time, roll a Quick Contest once per second: your Invisibility Art vs. the Vision roll of each person who can see you.\nViewers must apply the current darkness penalty to their Vision roll. A viewer who is concentrating on something else or otherwise distracted is at -3; one who is specifically looking for intruders gets +3. If someone sees you and raises the alarm, by pointing and crying out, those who believe the warning get +3 on their next roll.\nIf you win, that person is unable to see you for one second. Otherwise, he can see you normally. Once someone notices you, he is unaffected by this skill until you can get out of sight somehow (which might be as easy as stepping into a shadow), whereupon you may try again.\nNote that this skill does not work at all in combat. In particular, if you attack anyone, you will immediately become visible to everyone!",
  "skill-description-lifting": "This is the trained ability to use your strength to its best advantage when you lift. Roll once per lift. On a success, increase your Basic Lift by 5% per point by which you made your roll. This has no effect on encumbrance, or on how much you can carry. See Lifting and Moving Things (p. 353).",
  "skill-description-escape": "This is the ability to slip out of ropes, handcuffs, and similar restraints. The first attempt to escape takes one minute; each subsequent attempt takes 10 minutes.\nThe GM may apply a penalty for particularly secure bonds. For instance, modern police handcuffs would give -5 to Escape. You suffer only half these penalties if you dislocate the restrained limb (usually an arm). This requires (20 skill) minutes of concentration, minimum one minute and a Will roll. However, if you fail your Escape roll by 3 or more when dislocating a limb, the limb suffers 1d damage. On a critical failure, you automatically take enough damage to cripple the limb!",
  "skill-description-savoir-faire-police": "Knowledge of police protocols, procedures, and customs.",
  "skill-description-gambling": "This is skill at playing games of chance. A successful Gambling roll can (among other things) tell you if a game is rigged, identify a fellow gambler in a group of strangers, or 'estimate the odds' in any tricky situation. When you gamble against the house, make a skill roll (the GM will secretly modify this roll if the odds are poor!). When you gamble against someone else, roll a Regular Contest of Gambling (p. 197) until one of you wins.\nSleight of Hand skill (p. 221) is helpful if you want to cheat! To spot a cheater, roll a Quick Contest of your Gambling or Vision roll, whichever is higher, vs. your opponent’s Sleight of Hand skill (for card or dice tricks) or IQ (for other kinds of cheating).",
  "skill-description-acting": "This is the ability to counterfeit moods, emotions, and voices, and to lie convincingly over a period of time. A successful Acting roll lets you pretend to feel something that you do not. The GM may also require an Acting roll whenever you try to fool someone, play dead in combat, etc.\nImpersonation is a special type of acting. To impersonate someone, you must first successfully disguise yourself (see Disguise, p. 187) – unless your victims cannot see you!\nNote that Acting is not the same Fast-Talk (the art of the 'quick con') or Performance (the skill of screen and stage acting).",
  "skill-description-zen-archery": "This skill allows you to strike difficult targets with ease when using a bow. On a success, add up the penalties for size and speed/range, and then divide them by three (round down).",
  "skill-modifiers-zen-archery": "-10 if used instantly, dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concentration, -4 after 2 turns, -3 after 4 turns, -2 after 8 turns, -1 after 16 turns, and no penalty after 32 turns.",
  "skill-description-swimming": "This is the skill of swimming (whether on purpose or to keep afloat in emergencies) and lifesaving. Roll against the higher of Swimming or HT to avoid fatigue while swimming or injury due to aquatic misfortunes.\nWhen racing someone of equal water Move, roll a Quick Contest of Swimming to determine the winner. See Swimming (p. 354).\nNote that Swimming does not cover high diving – that’s Sports (Diving).",

  "skill-description-expert-skill-political-science": "Specialized knowledge of political systems, theories, and processes.",
  "skill-description-light-walk": "This skill allows you to exert very little pressure when you walk. On a successful Light Walk roll, you leave no visible tracks. Tracking rolls to follow you automatically fail unless they rely on something more than sight; thus, a human tracker would be baffled, but bloodhounds would suffer no penalty at all.\nYou can also attempt to walk over fragile surfaces without falling through. Maximum Move under such circumstances is 1/3 normal (GM’s decision). Thin ice would require an unmodified Light Walk roll, while rice paper would require a roll at -8!\nFinally, a successful Light Walk roll can give a bonus to Stealth when your intention is to move quietly. This bonus equals half your margin of success, rounded down. Minimum bonus is +1.",
  "skill-description-environment-suit": "This is training in the use of a specific class of protective suit. Suits designed to shield the wearer from environmental or battlefield hazards frequently incorporate gadgets (such as autoinjectors and sensors) and lifesupport equipment. Some suits even contain motors to enhance ST or Move. As a result, you do not merely wear such gear – you operate it.\nRoll against Environment Suit skill to get into or out of your suit quickly. A successful roll halves the time required. To activate a specific subsystem of a suit, or to gauge whether a suit is in good repair, make an IQbased skill roll instead.\nWhen rolling against DX or any DX-based skill while suited up, use the lower of your Environment Suit skill and your actual skill level. For instance, if you have DX 14, Stealth15, and Vacc Suit-13, you will function at DX 13 and Stealth-13 while wearing a spacesuit. Particularly ungainly suits might give -1 or more to DX on top of this, regardless of skill level. On the other hand, some sleek, ultra-tech suits might not limit skills at all!\nHowever, Environment Suit is strictly the skill of donning and operating the suit. Familiarity with and knowledge of dangerous environments is covered by other skills: Free Fall, Hazardous Materials, Survival, etc.\nEach suit type requires its own skill. Examples include:\nBattlesuit/TL: All kinds of powered battle armor and exoskeletons. Battle armor and exoskeletons are similar but not identical. If you only have experience with one, you are at -2 to operate the other until you gain familiarity (see Familiarity, p. 169).\nDiving Suit/TL: All types of hard diving suits (as opposed to the wetsuits and drysuits used with Scuba skill). This includes 'open dress' gear at TL5 and 'hard hat' gear at TL6, both of which use a sealed helmet and supplied air, but not always a full, sealed suit. At TL7+, this skill covers true underwater 'hardsuits.' The GM may require Swimming rolls to maneuver while wearing such a suit. Default: Scuba-2.\nNBC Suit/TL: All forms of hazardous materials ('HazMat') gear – including sealed, unpowered body armor that can be buttoned down against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) threats. Without this skill, you run the risk of misusing the equipment and being exposed to contamination. To improvise NBC gear, make an IQ-based skill roll at -5 to -15 to skill.\nVacc Suit/TL: Any kind of spacesuit. In addition to true vacuum suits, this includes suits intended for use in highpressure, corrosive, and poisonous atmospheres.\nBattlesuit, NBC Suit, and Vacc Suit default among themselves at -2. Diving Suit defaults to or from any other Environment Suit skill at -4.\nNote that unpowered, unsealed body armor never requires an Environment Suit skill.",

It includes knowledge of how to pace yourself in different conditions, and how best to carry a pack. Make a Hiking roll before each day’s march; on a success, increase the distance traveled by 20%. The GM may allow bonuses for good maps and good walking shoes, but not for terrain. If a party is traveling together, all must make the Hiking roll in order to get the increased distance. See Hiking (p. 351).",
  "skill-modifiers-hiking": "Very Bad Terrain (x 0.20): Deep snow, dense forest, jungle, mountains, soft sand, or swamp.\nBad (x 0.50): Broken ground (including streams), forest, or steep hills, Low quality roads\nAverage (x 1.00): Light forest, rolling hills, most roads in fine weather, Snow when using skis and Skiing skill\nGood (x 1.25): Hard-packed desert, level plains, solid ice with skates and Skating skill",
  "skill-description-push": "This skill allows you to channel your chi in order to 'gently' push away an adversary or cause him to lose his balance. Roll against Push skill to hit. This counts as a barehanded attack (see Shove, p. 372), and your target may attempt any legal active defense.\nIf you hit, use the higher of your ST or your Push skill as your effective ST. Roll swing damage for that ST, and double the result. For instance, if you had ST 10 and Push-15, you would roll swing damage for ST 15 (2d+1), and double it. This damage inflicts knockback (see Knockback, p. 378) but never actual physical injury.",

Defaults: Broadsword-4 or Force Sword-4.",
  "skill-description-pressure-points": "This is the art of striking pressure points in order to disable an opponent. To use this ability, you must make a successful attack with Karate (or other appropriate combat skill; see below). This attack is at -2 in addition to any hit location modifier (see Hit Location, p. 398). If at least one point of damage penetrates the target’s DR, roll a Quick Contest of Pressure Points vs. the victim’s HT.\nIf you win, you temporarily disable your target. A limb is paralyzed and effectively crippled for 5d seconds. A hit to a torso pressure point interferes with the victim’s breathing, resulting in suffocation (see Suffocation, p. 436); he may roll against HT every second to recover. A hit to the face stuns the victim; he gets an IQ roll every second to recover. A blow to the skull blinds the victim for 2d seconds; see Blindness (p. 124).\nYou can also use Pressure Points with Judo. Roll the Quick Contest described above after successfully applying a lock. This is in addition to any other effects of the lock.\nThe GM may permit warriors to learn specialties of this skill for use with crushing weapons. Examples include Pressure Points (Bow) for use with blunt arrows, Pressure Points (Shortsword) for use with a baton, and Pressure Points (Staff) for use with a staff.",
  "skill-description-naturalist": "This skill – crucial for fantasy druids and rangers – represents practical (as opposed to scientific) knowledge of nature in its many forms. It includes just enough Biology to tell dangerous plants and animals from benign ones; just enough Geology to locate a cave to shelter in; and just enough Meteorology to know when to take shelter. Roll vs. skill to do any of these things.\nIn settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must specialize by planet. The specialties for planets of the same type (see Planet Types, p. 180) default to one another at -4. Any larger difference results in no default.",
  "skill-description-holdout": "This is the skill of concealing items on your person or on other people (usually with their cooperation). An item’s size and shape govern its concealability. Some examples:\n+4: A BB-sized jewel, a postage stamp.\n+3: A pea-sized jewel.\n+2: One lockpick, a huge jewel, a dime, a TL9+ computer disk, a letter.\n+1: A set of lockpicks, a silver dollar.\n0: A TL8 floppy disk or CD, without case.\n-1: A dagger, a slingshot, the tiniest handgun or grenade.\n-2: An average handgun (e.g., a Luger), a grenade, a large knife.\n-3: A submachine gun, a shortsword, a short carbine.\n-4: A broadsword, an assault rifle.\n-5: A bastard sword, a battle rifle.\n-6: A crossbow, a heavy sniper rifle.\nThings that move or make noise give an additional -1 or more to skill.\nClothing also modifies effective skill. A Carmelite nun in full habit (+5 to skill) could conceal a bazooka or a battle-axe from an eyeball search. A Las Vegas showgirl in costume (-5 to skill) would have trouble hiding even a dagger. Of course, the showgirl might escape search entirely (unless the guards were bored) because 'She obviously couldn’t hide anything in that outfit!' Full nudity is -7 to skill.\nA proper concealment holster helps conceal a weapon; use the equipment modifiers on p. 345. Clothing designed specifically to hide things gives a bonus of up to +4.\nTo spot a concealed item, roll a Quick Contest of Search skill vs. Holdout. Search defaults to Perception-5 if you haven’t studied it. See Search (p. 219) for additional rules.",
  "skill-description-heraldry": "This is the skill of recognizing and designing coats of arms, crests, flags, tartans, and other emblems. A successful roll lets you recognize a knight or a noble from his banner or shield, create attractive and proper arms (without conflicting with existing designs), etc.\nIn some settings, you might have to specialize in a particular type of Heraldry: Coats of Arms (the usual specialty, described above), Corporate Logos (defaults to Current Affairs (Business)-3), or even Graffiti Tags (defaults to Streetwise-3).",
  "skill-description-knot-tying": "This is the ability to tie a wide variety of knots quickly and efficiently. A successful skill roll lets you make a noose, tie someone up, etc. If you bind someone using this skill, he must win a Quick Contest of Escape vs. your Knot-Tying skill to free himself.",

Furthermore, you have half the usual penalty for parrying more than once with the same hand (see Parrying, p. 376).\nNote that fencing weapons are light and likely to break when used to parry a heavier weapon. They cannot parry flail weapons at all! You must be relatively mobile to capitalize on their speed and maneuverability: all attacks and parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level (e.g., Heavy encumbrance gives -3 to hit or to parry).\nThe skills in this category default to one another at -3.

A successful roll gives some information about the patient’s problem – limited to realistic knowledge for your tech level.

(PCs can decide for themselves if they want to follow you!)\nYou may attempt a Leadership roll in combat if you spend your turn doing nothing but giving orders and encouragement. On a success, everyone on your side who can hear you (including PCs) has +1 on all combatrelated Fright Checks and morale checks, and on self-control rolls for disadvantages that would reduce combat efficiency (such as Berserk and Cowardice – or Bloodlust, if you wish to take prisoners). A critical success gives +2. The bonus lasts until your next turn, at which time you may roll again. A group can have only one leader, however! If multiple people attempt Leadership rolls, no one gets a bonus.\nNote that a minimum level of Leadership is often a prerequisite for high Rank (p. 29).",
  "skill-description-power-blow": "This is the ability to draw on your inner strength to deliver a devastating blow in melee combat. Roll once per attack. Power Blow costs 1 FP per attempt, successful or not.\nIf successful, double your ST for damage purposes for the next attack only. This attack takes all normal modifiers, and must occur immediately after the Power Blow roll. If you know Power Blow at better than skill 20, you can triple your ST by accepting an extra -10 to the skill roll.\nYou can also use this skill in non-combat situations. For instance, you could use Power Blow to double or triple your ST momentarily in order to move a heavy object. Such feats cost 1 FP and require a skill roll, as described above.",

If your subjects suspect that you can read lips, they can hide their mouths or subvocalize to thwart you. A critical failure on a Lip Reading roll – if you are where your victims could see you – means that you stared so much you were noticed!",
  "skill-description-jitte-sai": "A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.\nAny tined, one-handed sword designed to catch rigid weapons. Jitte/Sai weapons are built for disarming, and give +2 in the Quick Contest to disarm an opponent (see Knocking a Weapon Away, p. 401). Furthermore, if you attempt to disarm on the turn immediately after you parry your opponent’s weapon, you need not roll to hit his weapon first.Just state that you are attempting to disarm and move directly to the Quick Contest!

It is not just the ability to make someone look 'pretty' – you can make yourself or others look older, younger, or of a different race or nationality. At TL6+, you can use prosthetics to further enhance the effect. However, you cannot make someone look taller or shorter than he actually is.",
  "skill-description-computer-programming": "This is the ability to write and debug computer software. A successful roll lets you find a bug in a program, determine a program’s purpose by examining the code, answer a question about computer programming, or write a new program (time required is up to the GM).\nIn settings where artificial intelligence (AI) exists, those who wish to work with AI must learn Computer Programming (AI).

It is usually associated with a magical or spiritual tradition. The particulars vary by tradition, but might include acupuncture, massage, alchemical or herbal preparations, or such exercises as breath control and meditation.\nThe effectiveness of Esoteric Medicine relative to Physician (p. 213) is up to the GM. It might be more effective (especially if it can channel real supernatural power), equivalent but different, or less effective. It should always be at least as good as First Aid (p. 195) – the attentions of a trained healer of any kind are preferable to bleeding to death! In TL5+ settings, Esoteric Medicine is often perceived as 'quack' medicine, regardless of actual effectiveness.\nThis skill might represent Ayurvedic medicine, chi treatment, Hermetic medicine, yin/yang healing, or any other historical or fictional healing discipline. In settings where multiple forms of treatment exist, healers must specialize in one specific tradition.",
  "skill-description-politics": "This is the ability to get into office and get along with other politicians. It has nothing to do with administration!

You get +2 to skill to perform a specific, lengthy mental task (e.g., break a code or write a computer program), but -2 to all unrelated IQ, Perception, and skill rolls. The task must be a relatively sedate one, done in a quiet place (library, lab, monastery, or placid wilderness).\nIncrease Will. You get +2 to Will (+5 on a critical success) for one hour. This applies to all attempts to resist interrogation, torture, or magical or psionic attack. This roll is at -2.\nNegate Pain/Fatigue.

  "skill-description-flail": "A flail is any flexible, unbalanced weapon with its mass concentrated in the head. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn. Because flails tend to wrap around the target’s shield or weapon, attempts to block them are at -2 and attempts to parry them are at -4. Fencing weapons and knives cannot parry them at all! An unarmed fighter can parry a flail, but at -4 in addition to any penalty for parrying unarmed.",
  "skill-description-spear-thrower": "This is the ability to use the spear thrower: a long, flat stick with a notch or a loop at one end.

Each trick requires a separate skill roll, at whatever penalties the GM sees fit. If you are performing stunts on a moving vehicle or mount, roll against the lower of Acrobatics and the appropriate Driving or Riding skill.\nYou may substitute an Acrobatics roll for a DX roll in any attempt to jump, roll, avoid falling down, etc. As well, you may attempt an Acrobatic Dodge in combat – a jump or roll that avoids an attack in a flashy way (see Acrobatic Dodge, p. 375). Finally, a successful Acrobatics roll will reduce the effective distance of any fall by five yards (see Falling, p. 431).",
  "skill-modifiers-acrobatics": "+1 to these three skills if you have Perfect Balance (p. 74)\n+2 to Aerobatics if you have 3D Spatial Sense (p. 34)",
  "skill-description-exorcism": "This is the ability to drive a spirit from a possessed person or haunted location. It is not a magical skill, but a religious ritual. Exorcism is not specific to any one religion. A Malay witch doctor and a Catholic priest can both perform exorcisms; their relative effectiveness depends on the originating culture of the spirit.\nThe length of the ritual is 15 minutes ¥ the spirit’s HT. Some spirits wait patiently through the ritual, anticipating the combat to come; others try to distract or even attack you before you can complete the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, roll against Exorcism skill.\nOn a failure, the spirit remains and you must wait at least a week before you can repeat the ritual. On a critical failure, immediately roll 3d+10 on the Fright Check Table (p. 360). Even if you keep your sanity, you may never attempt to exorcise this particular spirit again.\nOn a critical success, you immediately banish the spirit. On a regular success, you meet your opponent in a Quick Contest: your Exorcism skill vs. the higher of the spirit’s ST or Will.\nWhen fighting a spirit in a living host, add higher of the ST or Will of the possession victim to your Exorcism skill as he tries to 'push the spirit out.'\nIf the spirit wins or ties, it retains its current status and you must wait at least a week before you can repeat the ritual. If you win, you drive the spirit from its haunt or victim. The spirit of a deceased mortal is laid to rest. For demons and similar entities, make a reaction roll. On a 'Poor' or better reaction, the spirit flees in humiliation. On a 'Bad' or worse reaction, the spirit immediately uses whatever resources it has to take vengeance on you and those nearby.\nIf the exorcism fails at any stage, make an IQ roll afterward. A success means that you learned something about the spirit that will help you in your next attempt to banish that foe, giving you +2 on later skill rolls. You may only claim this bonus once for a particular spirit.",
  "skill-description-submarine": "This is the ability to operate a specific type of underwater vehicle. As with Piloting, the default is to IQ, but when you learn the skill, always base it on DX.\nRoll against Submarine to dive or to surface, to maneuver in underwater combat, or to negotiate hazardous waters. Failure can mean anything from a slight drift off course to a collision; critical failure may strand the vessel underwater!\nMake an IQ-based Submarine roll for basic chart reading or practical oceanography, or to recall nautical laws and regulations.\nYou must specialize:\nFree-Flooding Sub: Any small, open submersible. The crew is exposed to the water, and must wear underwater breathing gear. Prerequisites: Diving Suit or Scuba. Defaults: Large Sub-5 or Mini-Sub-4.\nLarge Sub: Any crewed, long-duration submersible, including attack subs and missile subs. Defaults: Free-Flooding Sub-5 or Mini-Sub-4.\nMini-Sub: Any small, closed, short-duration submersible, typical of those used for scientific research. Defaults: Free-Flooding Sub-4 or Large Sub-4.",

  "skill-description-whip": "A whip is a flexible weapon made from a length of chain, leather, wire, etc. A whip can be up to seven yards long – but note that a whip two yards or more in length cannot strike at one yard or closer, and is slow to ready after an attack. A whip tends to wind around its target, making it an excellent disarming and entangling weapon. However, a whip’s lack of rigidity makes it a poor parrying weapon. For details, see Special Melee Weapon Rules (p. 404).",
  "skill-description-performance": "This is the ability to act on the stage or screen. It is different from Acting in that you are trying to impress and entertain people – not deceive them.

  "skill-description-karate": "This skill represents any advanced training at unarmed striking, not just the Okinawan martial art of karate. Roll against Karate to hit with a punch (at no -4 for the 'off' hand), or Karate-2 to hit with a kick. You cannot use Karate to attack with claws, teeth, etc., or with a blackjack – use Brawling (p. 182) for that. Karate skill does let you make several special attacks, however; see Special Unarmed Combat Techniques (p. 403).\nKarate improves damage: if you know Karate at DX level, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate damage with Karate attacks: punches, kicks, elbow strikes, etc. Add +2 per die if you know Karate at DX+1 or better! Work out damage ahead of time and record it on your character sheet.\nKarate allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. This parry is not at the usual -3 for parrying a weapon barehanded, greatly reducing the likelihood of injury when you defend against an armed foe. In addition, Karate gives an improved retreating bonus when you parry; see Retreat (p. 377). For more on parrying barehanded, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).\nTo use Karate, any hand with which you wish to strike or parry must be empty (but you are free to wear heavy gauntlets, brass knuckles, etc. to increase damage). Because Karate relies heavily on footwork, all Karate attacks and parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level. For instance, Heavy encumbrance would give you -3 to hit or to parry an enemy attack.",
  "skill-description-psychology": "This is the skill of applied psychology, which may be learned by academic study or lengthy observation of human nature. Roll against skill to predict the general behavior of an individual or small group in a particular situation – especially a stressful situation.\nIn settings with multiple sapient species, you must specialize by race. Defaults between specialties are up to the GM.\nIf the GM desires extra detail, he may rule that Psychology is split into two specialties: Applied (described above) and Experimental (for scientists who run rats in mazes and so forth). Applied defaults to Experimental-5; Experimental does not default to Applied, as a shrewd observer of people may lack training in scientific procedures.",
  "skill-description-occultism": "This is the study of the mysterious and the supernatural. An occultist is an expert on ancient rituals, hauntings, mysticism, primitive magical beliefs, psychic phenomena, etc. Note that an occultist does not have to believe in the material he studies!\nIn worlds where everyone knows that paranormal powers exist, Occultism covers lore about these powers and their users. A good roll might provide insights into phenomena that aren’t related to known powers. However, Occultism provides no details on how talented individuals invoke their powers. For instance, a fantasy occultist would know what magic can accomplish, and could provide advice on slaying demons, but without Thaumatology skill (p. 225), he could not explain the gestures, words, and symbols used by wizards.\nIn campaigns where many supernatural forces coexist, the GM may require occultists to specialize in such fields as Demonology (the study of demons, possession, and pacts), Pneumatology (the study of spirits), and Vampirology (the study of vampires).",
  "skill-description-electronics-operation-electronic-warfare": "Proficiency in operating electronic warfare systems and countermeasures.",
  "skill-description-electrician": "This is the skill of building, maintaining, and repairing electrical systems. Make a skill roll to diagnose an electrical fault, wire a building or vehicle, etc. Adventuring uses include damage control in combat (e.g., to restore power to a damaged vehicle system) and cutting the power to a building prior to clandestine activities.\nNote that electrical and electronic systems are not the same thing. The equivalent skill for electronics is Electronics Repair (p. 190).",
  "skill-description-camouflage": "This is the ability to use natural materials, special fabrics and paints, etc. to hide yourself, your position, or your equipment. To see through your camouflage, an observer must win a Quick Contest of Vision or Observation skill (p. 211) vs. your Camouflage skill.\nDepending on the circumstances, successful camouflage might hide its subject entirely or merely blur its outlines to make it harder to hit (-1 to attacker’s skill). Camouflage will not improve your Stealth roll, but if you fail a Stealth roll while camouflaged, those who heard you must still see through your camouflage to see you.",
  "skill-description-jeweler": "This is the ability to work with precious metals, make jewelry, decorate weapons, etc. A successful skill roll allows you to identify a precious metal or gem, or determine the value of a precious bauble.",

All require two hands.\nAny very long (at least 2 yards), unbalanced pole weapon with a heavy striking head, including the glaive, halberd, poleaxe, and countless others. Polearms become unready after an attack, but not after a parry. Defaults: Spear-4, Staff-4, or Two-Handed Axe/Mace-4.",
  "skill-description-linguistics": "This is the study of the principles upon which languages are based. A successful skill roll lets you identify a language from a snatch of speech or writing. As well, make a skill roll once per month when learning a language without a teacher. On a success, you learn at full speed rather than at 1/4 speed (see Learning Languages, p. 25).",
  "skill-description-free-fall": "This is the ability to operate in a free-fall (zero-gravity) environment. Roll against the higher of HT or Free Fall when you first enter free fall; see Space Adaptation Syndrome (p. 434) for the effects of failure. In addition, whenever you make a DX or DX-based skill roll in free fall, use the lower of Free Fall and your DX or skill. For instance, if you had Free Fall-14 and Karate-16, you would roll at 14 or less to land a punch.",
  "skill-description-sleight-of-hand": "This is the ability to 'palm' small objects, do coin and card tricks, etc. Make a skill roll to perform one piece of simple 'stage magic.' A failed roll means you blew the trick.\nWhen you use this skill to steal, you must win a Quick Contest of Sleight of Hand vs. the Vision roll or Observation skill of potential witnesses to perform the theft unnoticed.\nYou can also use this skill to cheat at cards, dice, etc. A successful Sleight of Hand roll gives from +1 to +5 on your Gambling roll. Any failure causes you to be denounced as a cheater! In both cases, the exact results are up to the GM.",
  "skill-modifiers-sleight-of-hand": "+3 if the light is dim\n+3 if you have a confederate to distract attention\n+5 if you have prepared in advance (cards up your sleeve, etc.)\n-3 if the person you want to fool knows Sleight of Hand himself\nHigh Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138)",
  "skill-description-urban-survival": "This talent covers the physical part of staying alive in a city environment, whether it’s overpopulated or empty. (The social problems of city survival are covered by Streetwise skill.) A successful skill roll allows you to find clean rainwater; locate manholes from above or below; quickly locate building entrances, exits, stairwells, etc.; recognize and avoid physically dangerous areas, such as crumbling buildings; make and read city maps; find your way out of strange city areas; find a warm place to sleep outside in cold weather; and locate common types of buildings or businesses without asking anyone, just by your 'feel' for the way cities are laid out.",
  "skill-description-forensics": "This is the ability to apply the principles of forensic science and criminalistics, such as the computation of bullet paths and the microscopic or chemical analysis of clues. Some disciplines require other skills. For instance, a forensic pathologist performing an autopsy would roll against Surgery skill.",

  "skill-description-metallurgy": "This is the study of metals and their properties. A successful roll lets you identify metals or alloys, or solve a problem concerning metals, their use, mining, or refining.",
  "skill-description-rapier": "Fencing weapons are light, one-handed weapons, usually hilted blades, optimized for parrying. If you have a fencing weapon, you get an improved retreating bonus when you parry – see Retreat (p. 377). Furthermore, you have half the usual penalty for parrying more than once with the same hand (see Parrying, p. 376).\nNote that fencing weapons are light and likely to break when used to parry a heavier weapon. They cannot parry flail weapons at all! You must be relatively mobile to capitalize on their speed and maneuverability: all attacks and parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level (e.g., Heavy encumbrance gives -3 to hit or to parry).\nThe skills in this category default to one another at -3. They also default to sword skills, as noted below.",
  "skill-description-carousing": "This is the skill of socializing, partying, etc. A successful Carousing roll, under the right circumstances, gives you a +2 bonus on a request for aid or information, or just on a general reaction. A failed roll means you made a fool of yourself in some way; you get a -2 penalty on any reaction roll made by those you caroused with. If you do your carousing in the wrong places, a failed roll can have other dangers!",
  "skill-description-spear": "Pole weapons are long (usually wooden) shafts, often adorned with striking heads. All require two hands.\nAny long, balanced pole weapon with a thrusting point, including spears, javelins, tridents, and fixed bayonets. Defaults: Polearm-4 or Staff-2.",
  "skill-description-musical-influence": "This cinematic skill allows you to influence the emotions of others by playing a musical instrument or singing. In some settings, this is a magical or psionic talent, or a special form of hypnotism, and works with any instrument, as well as with voice. In other settings, this skill is associated with a specific type of magical or ultra-tech instrument.\nTo attempt Musical Influence, you must first get your audience to sit and listen to your performance. You must also make a successful Musical Instrument or Singing roll. You may then roll against your Musical Influence skill. On a success, you can adjust the reaction roll of your audience – to you or to anyone present – up or down by an amount equal to your margin of success, to a maximum of +3 (+4 for critical success).\nIf you have only a few seconds, or if the audience is not paying full attention to your performance, you may adjust reaction rolls by ±1 at most, regardless of your margin of success.\nListeners who do not wish to be influenced may resist with Will. Hard of Hearing (p. 138) gives +4 to resist, and those with Deafness (p. 129) are completely immune. However, some science-fiction devices generate vibrations that affect the body, in which case a listener’s sense of hearing is irrelevant.\nIt is up to the GM to determine whether this skill works on animals as well as sapient beings. In classic fantasy, it just might!",

  "skill-description-mimicry-bird-calls": "Ability to imitate bird calls and vocalizations.",
  "skill-description-forgery": "This is the ability to create falsified documents (identity cards, passports, etc.). It is not taught except by intelligence agencies and the underworld – although you can always study it on your own. The time required to create a forgery ranges from days to weeks (GM decides). When you use a forged document, make your Forgery roll each time it is inspected – unless you roll a critical success on your first attempt. Failure means someone spots the forgery.\nSome tasks require DX-based skill rolls, in which case modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138) apply. The GM may allow Forgery to default to a suitable Artist specialty at -5 if you are doing the work entirely by hand.",

  "skill-description-breaking-blow": "This skill allows you to find the weakest spot in any object when making a barehanded attack. Each attack requires a separate Breaking Blow roll. Roll against skill after you hit. Breaking Blow costs 1 FP per attempt, whether or not you hit.\nOn a success, your attack gains an armor divisor of (5) against any braced, inanimate, homogenous target (see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets, p. 380), and you may treat the target as if it were Fragile (Brittle) (p. 136) for this one attack.\nIn a cinematic game, you are not limited to inanimate targets. Your armor divisor affects any artificial armor or force field (not natural DR), and you may treat homogenous opponents as if they were Fragile (Brittle)!\nOn a failure, your attack gains no special benefits. On a critical failure, you do the damage to your own hand or foot.",
  "skill-description-accounting": "This is the ability to keep books of account, to examine the condition of a business, etc. A successful Accounting roll (requires at least two hours of study, and possibly months to audit a large corporation) can tell you whether financial records are correct, and possibly reveal evidence of forgery, tampering, and similar criminal activity.",
  "skill-description-force-sword": "A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.\nAny sword with a 'blade' made of energy instead of matter. This generally refers to an ultra-tech weapon that projects energy from a powered hilt, but extends to similar effects produced using magic or psionics. Default: any sword skill at -3.",
  "skill-description-expert-skill-natural-philosofy": "Specialized knowledge of natural philosophy and natural sciences.",
  "skill-description-kiai": "You can channel your chi outward in a mighty shout (kiai) that freezes lesser foes. This counts as an attack, and costs 1 FP per attempt, successful or not.\nRoll a Quick Contest: your Kiai skill vs. your target’s Will. You are at -1 for every full two yards of distance. Your victim resists at +1 if he is Hard of Hearing, at +2 if Deaf! If you win, your target is mentally stunned (see Effects of Stun, p. 420).\nThis skill only works against a single victim; everyone can hear the shout, but your chi is focused on that one foe. However, a successful Kiai roll gives you +2 to Intimidation rolls vs. everyone within earshot.",
  "skill-description-observation": "This is the talent of observing dangerous or 'interesting' situations without letting others know that you are watching. Use this skill to monitor a location, a group of people, or your immediate surroundings for concealed or tactically significant details. This is not the same as gathering clues or making a hands-on search (use Forensics and Search, respectively) – you always use Observation from a distance.\nA successful skill roll lets you gather information that is not specifically hidden. For instance, you could case a bank for obvious cameras before a robbery, learn the schedule of sentries, estimate the size of a crowd, or gauge the strength of troops moving in the open. The GM may require an Intelligence Analysis roll to interpret what you observe.\nTo spot deliberately hidden details – e.g., someone trying to sneak up on you, an armed man hiding in the crowd, or a concealed machine-gun nest – you must win a Quick Contest of Observation skill vs. the Stealth, Shadowing, or Camouflage skill (as appropriate) of the other party. The GM should roll the Contest in secret, and should not say, 'You don’t see the machine gun nest concealed in the bushes.'\nIf your attempt fails, you get no details on an obvious item, or fail to spot a hidden one. On a critical failure, someone spots you and reacts poorly to the attention ...",
  "skill-description-sway-emotions": "This ability allows you to instill the audience with any one emotion. Allowed emotions include anger, boredom, depression, disgust, fear, greed, hate, jealousy, joy, love, lust, patriotism, peace, sadness, and unrest.\nIf you win the Quick Contest, your audience experiences the emotion you select. How they act as a result is up to the GM.\nTime: 10 minutes of uninterrupted storytelling.\nFatigue Cost: 4 FP, whether successful or not.\nDuration: One hour.",
  "skill-description-judo": "This skill represents any advanced training at unarmed throws and grapples – not just the eponymous Japanese martial art.\nJudo allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. This parry is not at the usual -3 for parrying a weapon barehanded, greatly reducing the likelihood of injury when you defend against an armed foe. In addition, Judo gives an improved retreating bonus when you parry; see Retreat (p. 377). For complete rules for parrying barehanded, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).\nOn the turn immediately after a successful Judo parry, you may attempt to throw your attacker if he is within one yard. This counts as an attack; roll vs. Judo skill to hit. (Note that in an All-Out Attack, you cannot attempt two throws, but you can make one attempt at +4.) Your foe may use any active defense – he can parry your hand with a weapon! If his defense fails, you throw him.\nWhen you throw a foe, he falls where you please. On a battle map, he lands in any two hexes near you. One of these hexes must be his starting hex, your hex, or any hex adjacent to one of those hexes. Your victim must roll against HT; a failed roll means he is stunned! If you throw him into someone else, that person must roll against the higher of ST+3 or DX+3 to avoid being knocked down.\nFinally, you may use your Judo skill instead of your DX for any DX roll made in close combat except to draw a weapon or drop a shield. If you grapple a foe using Judo, and he fails to break free, you may make a Judo attack to throw him on your next turn, exactly as if you had parried his attack.\nTo use Judo, any hand with which you wish to parry or grapple must be empty. Because Judo relies heavily on footwork, all Judo rolls and Judo parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level. For instance, Heavy encumbrance would give you -3 to hit or to parry an enemy attack.",
  "skill-description-aeronautics": "Knowledge of aircraft design, operation, and aviation principles.",
  "skill-description-writing": "This is the ability to write in a clear or entertaining manner. A successful roll means the work is readable and accurate.\nThis is mostly useful to earn a living or write for GURPS, but can sometimes help on adventures ... or after them. The report of a spy, soldier, or private investigator is far more useful if it is well-written!",
  "skill-modifiers-writing": "Time Spent modifiers often apply, although time-sensitive documents (such as reports from the front lines) might not have this luxury\n-5 if writing about an unfamiliar subject (winging it)\nLanguage modifiers apply if attempting to write (such as a report or letter) in a language you're not fully-versed in",

Roll against skill to hide an item from casual inspection. In an active search, the searchers must win a Quick Contest of Search vs. your Smuggling skill to find the item.",
  "skill-modifiers-smuggling": "Equipment modifiers (p. 345) for specialized smuggling gear. The difference between the Size Modifier (p. 19) of the package, vehicle, or room in which you are hiding the item and that of the item itself; e.g., to hide a bottle of liquor (SM -5) in a family car (SM +3), you would roll at +8.",
  "skill-description-gardening": "This is the ability to care for plants on a small scale. (For large-scale crops, use Farming skill, p. 194.) A skill roll lets you grow food, medicinal herbs, attractive flowers and trees, etc.",

  "skill-modifiers-veterinary": "+5 if the animal knows and trusts you\n-2 or worse if the animal is of an unfamiliar type",
  "skill-description-cryptography": "This is the ability to create and defeat encryption systems, codes, and ciphers. It is of use in wartime, espionage, and even business dealings. It covers all the techniques of your TL, which can range from unsophisticated substitution ciphers to state-of-the-art tactical encryption schemes.\nKnowledge of a specific system, code, or cipher depends on your Security Clearance (p. 82) and allegiances (national, administrative, or both). In many settings, some level of Security Clearance is a prerequisite to learning this skill at all.\nTreat an attempt to break an unknown code as a Quick Contest of Cryptography skill between the codebreaker and code-maker. The codebreaker must win to break the code. Repeated attempts are possible, but each attempt takes a day. The codemaker rolls only once, when he first creates the code.\nThose with Cryptography skill may take an optional specialty (p. 169) in making or breaking codes. (The codebreaking specialty is often called 'cryptanalysis.')\nCryptography normally has no IQ default, with two exceptions. Anyone can devise a trivial code or cipher by making an IQ-5 roll. This won’t stall a professional for long, of course. Likewise, anyone can make an IQ-5 roll to attempt to break such a trivial code (but not a code devised by someone with Cryptography skill), using the Quick Contest system described above.",

  "skill-description-mind-block": "This ability allows you to establish a mental block against psionic or magical attempts to eavesdrop on your thoughts and emotions. The techniques involved are wholly mundane – for instance, doing complicated mathematical calculations, or repeating poetry over and over again. With sufficient training, anyone can learn this skill.\nTo maintain a block, you must make a Mind Block roll once per minute. You must roll every second in combat or other stressful situations.\nIf you succeed, anyone who reads your mind must win a Quick Contest of his mind-reading ability vs. your Mind Block skill in order to get useful information. Otherwise, he gets nothing but poetry, multiplication tables, etc. However, if you ever critically fail a Mind Block roll, you thought about precisely what the mind reader wanted to know – in detail – right there in the forefront of your mind!\nThis skill only works against mind reading, not mind control or other mental attacks. If you have a supernatural mind shield, Mind Block acts as a last-ditch defense: only mental probes that pierce your magical or psionic defenses and contact your mind will encounter the block.",
  "skill-description-physician": "This is the ability to aid the sick and the injured, prescribe drugs and care, etc. Make a skill roll to hasten natural recovery from injury (see Recovery, p. 423), and whenever the GM requires a roll to test general medical competence or knowledge. Apply physiology modifiers (p. 181) if your patient is of a different species from you.\nAt TL4 and below, this skill does not exist in most game worlds. Instead, use Esoteric Medicine (p. 192), Pharmacy (Herbal) (above), or both.\nAt TL5+, medical knowledge is divided between Pharmacy (Synthetic) and Physician. A physician knows a great deal about drugs. He can identify most drugs fairly easily (at -5 without laboratory facilities but +3 if he takes the risk of smelling/tasting the substance), but he cannot formulate them unless he also learns Pharmacy.",
  "skill-description-expert-skill-thanatology": "Specialized knowledge of death, funerary customs, and the study of mortality.",
  "skill-description-search": "This is the ability to search people, baggage, and vehicles for items that aren’t in plain sight. The GM rolls once – in secret – per item of interest. For deliberately concealed items, this is a Quick Contest of your Search skill vs. the Holdout or Smuggling skill used to hide the item. If you fail, the GM simply says, 'You found nothing.' (It defeats the purpose to say, 'You don’t find the gun under his jacket.')\nIf more than one person is searching, roll separately for each searcher.\nThe GM should avoid unnecessary rolls. For instance, no human can get a sawed-off shotgun through a body search. Likewise, a knife or jewel simply cannot be found on a normally dressed person without an X-ray or skin search. In general, if the net bonus to the concealer’s Holdout roll is +3 or more, a skin search is required. If his Holdout is at -2 or worse for size, a skin search will automatically find the hidden item.",
  "skill-modifiers-search": "+1 for a 'pat-down' of an unresisting person (takes one minute), +3 for a thorough 'skin search' of a person’s hair and clothing (takes three minutes), or +5 for a complete search, including body cavities (takes five minutes). Bonuses for Acute Touch (p. 35) and Sensitive Touch (p. 83) apply to all hands-on searches. On a successful Electronics Operation (Security) roll, specialized sensors – metal detectors, X-ray machines, etc. – give from +1 to +5 to find items they can detect (a metal detector won’t help you find plastic explosives!).",
  "skill-description-alchemy": "This is the study of magical transformations and transmutations. In a magical game world, an alchemist would be able to identify concoctions with magical effects ('elixirs'), such as, love potions and healing unguents, and prepare them from suitable ingredients. This is a mechanical process, using the mana inherent in certain things; therefore, those without Magery can learn and use Alchemy, and Magery confers no benefit.",
  "skill-description-body-sense": "This is the ability to adjust quickly after teleportation or similar 'instant movement.' A successful roll lets you act normally on your next turn. A failed roll means disorientation: you may take no action other than defense for one turn. A critical failure means you fall down, physically stunned!",
  "skill-description-sex-appeal": "This is the ability to impress those who are attracted to members of your sex. It has as much to do with attitude as it does with looks. If you are not willing to 'vamp' someone to get what you want, you won’t have this skill – or want it.\nYou may substitute an Influence roll against Sex Appeal for any reaction roll made by someone who is attracted to members of your sex; see Influence Rolls (p. 359).\nUsually, you may make only one attempt per 'target,' although the GM might allow another attempt after a few weeks.",
  "skill-modifiers-sex-appeal": "+2 for Voice (p. 97); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157). Apply any bonus for above-average appearance (p. 21) – or double the penalty for below-average appearance!",

It can function as a baton, but you can also grasp it by the handle and hold it against the forearm in close combat. This grip lets you jab for thrust+1 crushing damage and parry close-combat attacks at (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Roll vs. skill to change grips. On a success, the grip change is a free action. On a failure, you must spend the entire turn changing grips. A critical failure means you throw your weapon away! Default: Shortsword-3.",
  "skill-description-computer-hacking": "This is the skill of gaining illegal access to a computer system – usually using another computer over a communications network. A successful Computer Hacking roll allows you to gain surreptitious access to a system, or to find (or change) information on a system you have already broken into. On a critical failure, you fail to gain access and leave some sort of incriminating evidence of your attempt.\nThis skill is cinematic, and simulates the way computer intrusion works in many movies and novels. It does not exist in realistic settings! Realistic 'hackers' should learn a combination of Computer Operation (to exploit OS loopholes and run intrusion software), Computer Programming (to write intrusion software), Cryptography, Electronics Operation (Communications or Surveillance), Electronics Repair (Computers), Fast-Talk (to convince legitimate users to reveal passwords), Research (to find documented security holes), and Scrounging (to 'Dumpster dive' for manuals, passwords on discarded sticky notes, etc.).",

  "skill-description-sumo-wrestling": "This unarmed combat skill represents any training at grabbing, shoving, and tripping – not just the traditional Japanese sport of sumo. Roll against the higher of DX or Sumo Wrestling to hit with a grapple, slam, or shove, or to make or resist a takedown. If you know this skill at DX+1 level, add +1 to ST whenever you make or resist a grapple or takedown, and whenever you attempt to break free, and +1 per die to your damage when you slam or shove. These bonuses increase to +2 if you know Sumo at DX+2 or better.\nWhen you defend with bare hands, Sumo Wrestling allows you to parry once per turn. You must use both hands. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. This parry is meant to ward off slams, grapples, and barehanded slaps. You parry at -2 vs. kicks and -3 vs. weapons. For complete rules for parrying barehanded, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).",

It includes locating targets (with map and compass at TL6-, global positioning systems and satellite imagery at TL7+), marking targets (using smoke, a laser designator, etc.), matching ordnance to target for best effect, and calling in corrections to any fire you personally observe.\nFailure means the ordnance misses the target; critical failures result in severe 'collateral damage' or 'friendly fire' incidents. The very worst critical failures (GM’s decision) drop the ordnance on your position!\nAt higher tech levels, Forward Observer is less about observing targets and more about operating specialized technology such as drones, GPS, and laser designators. To remotely pilot a drone or use a laser designator to direct 'smart' munitions onto a target, make a DX-based skill roll. At TL7+, Forward Observer defaults to Electronics Operation (any)-5.",
  "skill-description-intimidation": "This is the skill of hostile persuasion. The essence of Intimidation is to convince the subject that you are able and willing, perhaps even eager, to do something awful to him.\nYou can substitute an Intimidation attempt for any reaction roll; see Influence Rolls (p. 359). Exception: You cannot intimidate someone who has the Unfazeable advantage!\nThe results of a successful Intimidation attempt depend on the target. An honest citizen probably cooperates, sullenly or with false cheer. A low-life might lick your boots (even becoming genuinely loyal). A really tough sort might react well without being frightened: 'You’re my kind of scum!' The GM decides, and roleplays it. If you rolled a critical success – or if the subject critically failed his Will roll – your victim must make a Fright Check in addition to the other results of the Influence roll!\nGroup Intimidation: You may attempt to intimidate up to 25 people at once, at -1 to skill per five people (or fraction thereof) in the group. Multiple intimidators can attempt to intimidate proportionally larger groups; for instance, three thugs could try to intimidate up to 75 people! Base the skill penalty on the size of the target group divided by the number of intimidators (round up). Resolve the outcome with a single Quick Contest: the highest effective Intimidation skill from among the intimidators vs. the highest modified Will in the target group.\nSpecious Intimidation: You can attempt a Quick Contest of Fast-Talk vs. the subject’s IQ before your Intimidation attempt in order to appear to be intimidating when you can’t back it up. If you win, you are at +3 on the subsequent Intimidation attempt, which can go a long way toward offsetting the high Will and Fearlessness of martial arts masters, world leaders, etc. If you tie or lose, however, your Intimidation attempt fails automatically, and you suffer a 'Very Bad' reaction instead of just a 'Bad' one!",
  "skill-description-dropping": "This is the skill of dropping heavy objects on your foes while flying. Treat this as a ranged attack made from above. Learn Dropping if you wish to drop boulders and similar projectiles on individual opponents while on the wing. Use Artillery (Bombs) to attack areas with explosive ordnance, etc.",
  "skill-description-captivate": "This skill allows you to tell a story so skillfully that those listening lose their will and do whatever you want them to do. In effect, they believe themselves to be in the tale, and are vulnerable to being manipulated by you, the teller of the tale.\nIf you win the Quick Contest, the audience becomes intensely loyal to you. They follow any direct order you give. In the absence of a direct order, they act in your best interest, as they understand it. If you tell someone to do something very hazardous, or that goes against his usual code of behavior (GM’s decision), he gets a Will-5 roll to break the captivation. Otherwise, he is your loyal supporter for all intents and purposes.\nTime: 30 minutes of uninterrupted storytelling.\nFatigue Cost: 8 FP, whether successful or not.\nDuration: Captivation lasts until the subject becomes unconscious or falls asleep, you become unconscious or fall asleep, you attack the subject, or the subject loses half his HP to injury.",
  "skill-description-surgery": "This is skill at using invasive medical techniques to treat sickness or injury. Roll once per operation. On a success, the operation proceeded without complications. On a failure, the patient took damage – 2d for a simple amputation, 3d for other procedures. Surgery rolls can also facilitate recovery from wounds; see Surgery (p. 424).\nThis skill represents general surgical expertise, which is relatively rare in real life. Most surgeons have an optional specialty (p. 169) in a certain part of the body (brain, heart, etc.) or a specific type of surgery (cosmetic surgery, microsurgery, transplant surgery, etc.).",
  "skill-modifiers-surgery": "Equipment modifiers (p. 345); physiology modifiers (p. 181); -3 if the area or equipment cannot be properly cleaned and sterilized; -3 for head or chest surgery; -5 for undiagnosed problems.

  "skill-description-ventriloquism": "This is the ability to disguise and 'throw' your voice a short distance. A successful roll lets you throw your voice well enough to fool your audience.",
  "skill-modifiers-ventriloquism": "+5 if you have a dummy or confederate to distract your audience (it’s easier to 'see' a face talk than it is to believe the voice comes from an immobile object); -3 if the audience has reason to be suspicious.",
  "skill-description-throwing-art": "This is the cinematic ability to throw anything you are strong enough to lift: knives, medicine balls, televisions ... anything! Roll against skill to hit. Furthermore, if you know Throwing Art at DX level, add +1 to ST when figuring throwing distance, and +1 per die of damage with thrown weapons. These bonuses increase to +2 if you know Throwing Art at DX+1 or better. If you are a Weapon Master, this bonus is instead of the usual damage bonus for your weapon.\nYou can use the items you throw as improvised weapons. Treat forks, kitchen knives, and other long, sharp objects as daggers. Any small, blunt object does thrust+1 crushing damage. Baseball bats do swing+1 crushing. Pencils do thrust-3 impaling. Playing cards do thrust-3 cutting.\nThrowing Art lets you throw anything covered by the Throwing and Thrown Weapon skills. If you have Throwing Art, you do not need those skills.",
  "skill-description-flint-knapping": "Skill in crafting tools or weapons from stone through flaking and shaping techniques.",
  "skill-description-cloak": "This is the skill of using a cloak or a cape as a weapon. It covers the use of two types of cloak: the waist-length 'light cloak' (any cloak, cape, or coat weighing less than 5 lbs.) and the full-length 'heavy cloak' (any cloak weighing 5 lbs. or more).\nOffensively, you can use a cloak to entangle an opponent – see Special Melee Weapon Rules (p. 404) for details. You can also snap a cloak in your opponent’s face or simply use it to block his vision, either of which counts as a Feint maneuver.\nDefensively, a cloak works much like a shield. It provides a Defense Bonus (+1 if light, +2 if heavy) and gives a Block defense equal to (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. A cloak is not as robust as a shield, though! A light cloak has only DR 1 and 3 HP, while a heavy cloak has DR 1 and 5 HP.",
  "skill-description-combat-art": "You can opt to learn most combat skills in nonlethal forms aimed at either exhibition (Combat Art skill) or competition (Combat Sport skill).\nCombat Art skills emphasize graceful movements and perfect stances. Since these skills still give a default to full-fledged, lethal combat skills (see below), they are a logical choice for Pacifists who want some combat ability.\nCombat Sport skills concentrate on speed of movement and nondamaging attacks. A failed skill roll means a foul that might disqualify you from a tournament! You can make an IQ-based roll against Combat Sport to recall basic tournament rules, but to become a qualified judge or referee, learn the relevant Games skill (p. 197).\nCombat Art and Sport skills are DX-based, with the same difficulty level and defaults as the corresponding combat skill. A combat skill, its Art form, and its Sport form default among themselves at -3. For instance, Staff Art and Staff Sport are DX/Average skills that default to DX-5, just like Staff skill (p. 208). A fighter with Staff at 15 would have default Staff Art and Staff Sport skills of 12, while an athlete with Staff Sport at 15 would have Staff and Staff Art skills at 12 by default.",

  "skill-description-packing": "This is the ability to get loads on and off of pack animals quickly and efficiently. It also lets you get the best performance from pack animals on the road, judge such beasts before purchase, and select the best route for a pack train. If the beasts are ornery or badly trained (GM’s judgment), you must make a successful Animal Handling roll before you can attempt a Packing roll. A caravan without at least one master packer (Packing at 15+) moves at 80% its normal speed.",

  "skill-description-fire-eating": "This is the performance skill of extinguishing flames in your mouth without burning yourself. Make a skill roll for each item you wish to extinguish. On a success, you put out the flames. On a failure, you take 1d-3 damage (minimum 1) to your mouth.\nThis skill also includes fire breathing: igniting a stream of fuel blown from the mouth. At the GM’s option, you may use this as an attack (1d-3 damage).",
  "skill-description-axe-or-mace": "An impact weapon is any rigid, unbalanced weapon with most of its mass concentrated in the head. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn.",
  "skill-description-blind-fighting": "You have learned to fight blindfolded or in absolute darkness. As a result, you can 'sense' your targets without having to see them. This skill enables you to use senses other than vision – mainly hearing, but also touch and even smell – to pinpoint exactly where your opponents are. A successful roll allows one melee attack or active defense without any penalties for lighting (even total darkness), blindness (temporary or permanent), or an invisible foe. However, attacks made in total darkness, while blind, or against invisible enemies have an extra -2 to target specific hit locations.\nIf you also know Zen Archery (p. 228), you can shoot targets without seeing them by making rolls on both skills at -6.\nAn opponent who knows you possess this ability can foil it by winning a Quick Contest of Stealth-4 vs. your Blind Fighting each turn. If he wins, you cannot detect him. However, Invisibility Art (p. 202) never works on you; it is completely useless against this skill.",
  "skill-description-propaganda": "This is the skill of indirect persuasion through the media. It is used for psychological warfare by intelligence and military organizations, and for advertising and marketing in the civilian world. Use familiarity (p. 169) to reflect the differences between these areas.\nPropaganda works on groups, not individuals. The GM should set the effective Will of the target group based on its size, composition, and resistance to the desired outcome, and then use the Influence Rolls (p. 359) rules to determine the results. Success might inform the target audience or even alter its perceptions. Propaganda attempts nearly always take more time and exposure than ordinary Influence rolls, however; how much time is up to the GM.",
  "skill-description-parry-missile-weapons": "This skill lets you parry thrown or missile weapons with a ready melee weapon. If you are wearing wristbands or gloves with DR 2+, or have at least this much natural DR, you can also parry with your hands. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down – but based on Parry Missile Weapons skill, not your Melee Weapon or unarmed combat skill.",

Learn Computer Programming (below) to write software and Electronics Repair (Computers) (p. 190) to troubleshoot hardware.\nThis skill only exists in game worlds with computers. Individuals from settings without computers cannot even use it by default until they have had time to gain familiarity with computers! In settings where it is possible to 'jack' your brain into a computer, Computer Operation includes the ability to use a neural interface, but new users initially suffer a -4 penalty for unfamiliarity (see Familiarity, p. 169).",
  "skill-description-housekeeping": "This is the ability to manage a household. It covers both home economics and domestic chores: cleaning, cooking (but not haute cuisine, which requires the Cooking skill), minor repairs (any routine maintenance task that calls for a roll against Carpentry, Sewing, or a similar skill at +4 or better), etc. The main use of Housekeeping is to qualify for the job of 'homemaker,' but it can come in handy on adventures – for instance, to clean up evidence!",
  "skill-description-electronics-operation-surveillance": "Proficiency in operating surveillance equipment and monitoring systems.",
  "skill-description-jumping": "This skill represents trained jumping ability. When you attempt a difficult jump, roll against the higher of Jumping or DX. In addition, you may use half your Jumping skill (round down) instead of Basic Move when calculating jumping distance. For instance, Jumping-14 would let you jump if you had Basic Move 7. See Jumping (p. 352).",
  "skill-description-boxing": "This is the skill of trained punching. Roll against Boxing to hit with a punch. Boxing does not improve kicking ability – use Brawling (p. 182) or Karate (p. 203) for that.\nBoxing improves damage: if you know Boxing at DX+1 level, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate punching damage. Add +2 per die if you know Boxing at DX+2 or better! Work out damage ahead of time and record it on your character sheet.\nWhen you defend with bare hands, Boxing allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Boxing parries are at -2 vs. kicks and -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks. Boxing also gives an improved retreating bonus when you parry; see Retreat (p. 377). For more on barehanded parries, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).",
  "skill-description-scrounging": "This is the ability to find, salvage, or improvise useful items that others can’t locate. Each attempt takes an hour.

  "skill-description-seamanship": "Knowledge and skill in sailing and navigation at sea. See Crewman, p. 185.",
  "skill-description-suggest": "This ability lets you give your audience a single, simple suggestion. A suggestion should have no complex grammatical clauses – just a subject, verb, object, and at most two modifiers. 'Kill the king!' is acceptable; 'Kill the king if he doesn’t accede to our demands!' is not. A given subject gets +5 to resist if your suggestion goes against his personal safety, and +3 if it goes against his beliefs, convictions, or knowledge.\nIf you win the Quick Contest, the audience members try to act on the suggestion to the best of their abilities – each assuming that the idea was his own.\nTime: 20 minutes of uninterrupted storytelling.\nFatigue Cost: 6 FP, whether successful or not.\nDuration: 10 minutes – or longer, if you continue to talk to the audience and can make a successful Suggest roll every 10 minutes! Once the suggestion lapses, audience members only wonder why they acted the way they did if the suggestion was something they would never have done normally.",

  "skill-description-spacer": "Proficiency in operating and managing space-faring vessels and environments.",
  "skill-description-main-gauche": "Fencing weapons are light, one-handed weapons, usually hilted blades, optimized for parrying. If you have a fencing weapon, you get an improved retreating bonus when you parry – see Retreat (p. 377). Furthermore, you have half the usual penalty for parrying more than once with the same hand (see Parrying, p. 376).\nNote that fencing weapons are light and likely to break when used to parry a heavier weapon. They cannot parry flail weapons at all! You must be relatively mobile to capitalize on their speed and maneuverability: all attacks and parries take a penalty equal to your encumbrance level (e.g., Heavy encumbrance gives -3 to hit or to parry).\nThe skills in this category default to one another at -3. They also default to sword skills, as noted below.",
  "skill-description-tracking": "This is the ability to follow a man or an animal by its tracks. Make a Tracking roll to pick up the trail, then roll periodically to avoid losing it. The frequency and difficulty of these rolls depend on the terrain:\nJungle, Plains, or Woodlands: Roll every 30 minutes.\nArctic, Desert, Island/Beach, or Mountain: Roll at -2 every 15 minutes.\nSwampland: Roll at -4 every 5 minutes.\nUrban: Roll at -6 every minute!\nYou may also use this skill to cover your tracks. This doubles your travel time! A successful roll means you have hidden your tracks well enough that only someone else with this skill can see them. If another tracker follows you, the Tracking rolls above become Quick Contests of Tracking skill. If he loses any of the Contests, he loses your trail.\nTo stalk game once you have tracked it, use the Stealth skill (p. 222).",
  "skill-modifiers-tracking": "-5 if the trail is more than a day old, or -10 if more than a week old. +3 if you are following a man, or +6 if following a group of men. Superior senses help a lot: bonuses for Acute Vision (p. 35) and Discriminatory Smell (p. 49) usually apply, and many superhuman senses (Infravision, Subsonic Hearing, etc.) give situational bonuses.",

  "skill-description-market-analysis": "This is the skill of predicting the short-term behavior of bond, stock, and currency markets – usually in order to make money! It is the main job skill of professional traders and speculators. Make a skill roll to determine current market trends. On a critical success, you also learn whether a trend will continue or reverse in the future. On a failure, you get no clear answer. On a critical failure, you guess wrong.",
  "skill-description-fast-talk": "This is the skill of talking others into doing things against their better judgment. It is not taught (intentionally, that is) in school; you study it by working as a salesman, confidence man, lawyer, etc. In any situation that calls for a reaction roll, you may make an Influence roll against Fast-Talk instead; see Influence Rolls (p. 359).\nIf you have Fast-Talk at level 20 or better, you get +2 on all reaction rolls where you’re allowed to talk!\nNote that Fast-Talk differs from Acting (p. 174). In general, Fast-Talk is used to get someone to make a snap decision in your favor, while Acting is used for long-term dissimulation.\nHowever, there are situations in which the GM could allow a roll on either skill.",
  "skill-modifiers-fast-talk": "If you're Easy to Read, it gives opponents a +4 to resist your fast-talking.\nLow Empathy (-1)\nOblivious (-1)\nShyness (-1 to -4)\nStuttering (-2)\nTruthfulness (-5)",

  "skill-description-artist-woodworking": "Skill in crafting and working with wood to create functional or artistic pieces.",
  "skill-description-brainwashing": "This is the 'black art' of technological personality alteration and mind control. Only intelligence, military, and security services teach it – and only to individuals with suitable Rank or Security Clearance. Even then, it is rare outside police states (except perhaps during wartime).\nBrainwashing encompasses many techniques – some proven, others little better than witchcraft. Depending on the setting, these might include drugs, electroshock, hypnotism, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, social pressure, subliminal messages, or surgery ... and most likely a combination of several of these.\nRegardless of the techniques employed, brainwashing is handled as a Regular Contest (not a Quick Contest) between Brainwashing skill and the victim’s Will. Roll once per day. Obviously, the brainwasher has a tremendous advantage: even if the victim wins this time, it is only a matter of time before he slips.\nResults depend on how effective the GM deems brainwashing to be, but might include insanity, personality alteration, or suggestions that can be triggered by future events. In game terms, the victim can acquire almost any mental quirk or disadvantage.\nIn settings where neural interfaces exist, it might be possible to 'hack' the victim’s brain using a computer. This takes only a fraction of a second per attempt! Brain Hacking should be treated as its own skill, with Computer Hacking instead of Psychology as a prerequisite.\nThis skill normally has no default. However, GMs who wish to explore the gory details can specify the techniques used in their campaign and have Brainwashing default to one or more of Electronics Operation (Medical)-6, Hypnotism-6, Interrogation-6, Pharmacy-6, Psychology-6, or Surgery-6, as appropriate.",

All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.\nAny rigid, hilted blade less than one foot long, from a pocketknife to a bowie knife. A knife has a very small parrying surface, which gives you -1 to your Parry score. Defaults: Force Sword-3, Main-Gauche-3, or Shortsword-3.",
  "skill-description-photography": "This is the ability to use a camera competently, use a darkroom (TL5+) or digital imaging software (TL8+), etc., and to produce recognizable and attractive photos. You may roll at default to use a camera, but not to develop film or prints in a darkroom.",
  "skill-description-literature": "This is the study of the great writings. A student of literature would be knowledgeable in the realms of old poetry, dusty tomes, criticism, etc. This can be useful for finding clues to hidden treasure, sunken lands, Ancient Secrets, and the like. The work in question must be available in a language you read.",
  "skill-description-finance": "This is the skill of managing money. It is a practical application of Economics (p. 189), much as Engineer skill is a practical application of Physics. A successful skill roll lets you broker a financial deal, raise capital for a new corporation, balance a budget, etc.",
  "skill-description-pressure-secrets": "This skill represents knowledge of the most vulnerable vital points of the human body. It allows you to maim and kill by crushing and tearing vital organs and nerve clusters with deadly precision.\nTo use this ability, you must make a successful unarmed attack. This attack is at -2 in addition to any hit location modifier (see Hit Location, p. 398). If you hit, make a Pressure Secrets roll.\nOn a success, any damage that penetrates DR is doubled – or tripled if you targeted the vital organs. In effect, your hands and feet have become impaling weapons!\nYou can also use this ability with locks and similar grappling attacks. This represents knowledge of exactly where to apply pressure to tear or sprain joints and ligaments. After applying the lock, make a Pressure Secrets roll. On a success, double the damage, shock, or harmful effects of the lock for that turn.\nThis skill is unrealistic and potentially unbalancing. The GM should carefully weigh its impact before allowing it, and may wish to make it very difficult for PCs to learn – or even restrict it to deadly NPC opponents.",
  "skill-description-electronics-operation-medical": "Proficiency in using electronic medical equipment and devices.",
  "skill-description-filch": "This skill lets you steal objects that are sitting in plain sight ... without being spotted. Roll against skill to shoplift, snatch documents off a desk, etc. If someone is actively watching the item you wish to snatch, you must win a Quick Contest of Filch vs. his Vision roll (or Observation skill, p. 211) to perform the theft unnoticed.\nFilch only covers the theft itself. The GM might require rolls against Stealth to get close enough to make the attempt and Holdout to conceal stolen objects afterward.",
  "skill-description-meditation": "This is the ability to calm the emotions, control the mind, and relax the body. To use this skill, you must concentrate for (20 - skill) seconds, minimum one second, and then roll vs. skill. On a success, you enter a trance-like state, which you can maintain for hours.\nA meditative trance is required for certain rituals and is a common preparation for prayer. In addition, the GM may permit you to meditate on a particular moral dilemma. On a successful Meditation roll, the GM will 'enlighten' you, providing a hint as to which course of action 'feels' right.",

  "skill-description-blowpipe": "This is the ability to use a blowpipe. You can use this weapon to shoot small, usually poisoned, darts. You can also use it to blow powders at targets within one yard. Treat this as a melee attack, not as a ranged attack. Such attacks are always at +2 to hit.",
  "skill-description-throwing": "This is the ability to throw any small, relatively smooth object that fits in the palm of your hand. Examples include baseballs, hand grenades, and rocks. (Boomerangs, javelins, knives, etc. require their own specialized skills; see Thrown Weapon, below.) Roll against skill to hit. Furthermore, if you know Throwing at DX+1 level, add +1 to ST when figuring throwing distance (but not damage). Add +2 to ST for Throwing at DX+2 or better.\nIf you do not have this skill, roll against your default to hit a specific target, but against full DX to lob an object into a general area.",

  "skill-description-skiing": "This replaces Hiking skill (p. 200) when you are skiing cross-country and Running skill (p. 218) when you are racing. Roll once per day of routine travel. The GM may require much more frequent skill rolls – usually DX-based – in combat or chases, or for hazardous maneuvers, conditions, or speeds. In those situations, any failure indicates a fall, while critical failure means 1d damage to a randomly chosen limb.",
  "skill-description-brain-hacking": "See brainwashing",
  "skill-description-soldier": "This skill represents a combination of basic military training – the lessons taught at 'boot camp' or its equivalent in your game world – and actual combat experience. Only those who have served in an army, militia, etc. are likely to know it.\nThe GM may require a Soldier roll whenever circumstances would test your battlefield discipline (knowing when to shoot, use concealment, take cover, etc.) or skill at practical field survival (e.g., keeping your feet dry and eating when you get the chance). Roll daily during prolonged military action. Failure means an inconvenience – perhaps a minor piece of equipment fails. Critical failure indicates a disaster: 'friendly fire' incident, trench foot, etc.\nSoldier includes basic lessons in many fields covered by other skills. For instance, a TL8 soldier learns to strip his rifle without learning Armoury (Small Arms), to use a radio without learning Electronics Operation (Comm), to dig a foxhole without learning Engineer (Combat), and so forth. In a situation where someone with one of those skills would roll at +4 or better for a routine task (see Task Difficulty, p. 345), the GM may let you roll against Soldier skill instead. You do not receive the bonus that someone with the full-fledged skill would get, but you do suffer any situational penalties.\nSoldier can only substitute for skill rolls to do things that would be a believable part of basic training. This means the routine use of standard equipment by ordinary troops – not research, improvisation, or design, and never the operation of new or secret technologies! Soldier cannot replace weapon skills, either; you must buy all such skills separately.\nExample: If someone with Electronics Operation (Comm) would be at +4 to call HQ on a standard-issue radio, you could do so with a successful Soldier roll. However, you could not use Soldier to fix a broken radio, use an enemy radio, or transmit coded signals.",
  "skill-description-streetwise": "This is the skill of getting along in rough company. A successful Streetwise roll might let you learn (among other things) where any sort of illegal 'action' is; which local cops or bureaucrats can be bought, and for how much; and how to contact the local underworld. Note that you might also be able to get this information by asking a Contact (p. 44). This skill is a measure of your ability to make new connections as needed.\nYou may substitute an Influence roll against Streetwise for any reaction roll made in an underworld or 'bad neighborhood' situation; see Influence Rolls (p. 359).",
  "skill-modifiers-streetwise": "+3 if you have a tough reputation (either 'good' or 'bad') in the area; -3 if you are obviously a stranger in the area. -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154).",

A successful skill roll means the piece is a pleasant listening experience.\nTo compose for an ensemble or band without a conductor, you must have a skill level of IQ with at least one instrument in the composition and a skill level of IQ-2 with the rest. Roll at -1 per 'instrument group' after the first used in the piece; e.g., a jazz composition for a saxophone section, drums, and bass would require a roll at -2.\nTo compose for an orchestra or band with a conductor requires Group Performance (Conducting) skill (p. 198) at IQ level. Roll at -1 per general class of instruments after the first used in the piece. Classes include brass, percussion, strings, and woodwinds. Treat choir, harp, organ, or piano as its own class.\nThis skill includes the ability to read, write, and transcribe music in your culture’s notation system (if any).

Make a skill roll for basic map or chart reading, practical meteorology, or to recall laws and regulations that pertain to your vehicle.\nThis skill also lets you steer the vessel. It is easier than Piloting, Submarine, and similar skills because it only includes knowledge of how to steer. Specialists handle such activities as plotting courses and operating sensors. These experts report to the captain, who in turn tells you how to maneuver. Make a DX-based skill roll whenever you take the helm – but note that your effective skill cannot exceed your captain’s Shiphandling skill (p. 220).\nThe average Crewman skill of an entire crew can be used as a measure of overall crew quality. The GM rolls against average skill whenever the vehicle arrives or departs, in unfavorable conditions, or in battle. Failure and critical failure results depend on the circumstances.\nThere is a separate skill for each class of vessel:\nAirshipman/TL: The skill of handling ballast, gas valves, mooring lines, etc. on a blimp, zeppelin, or other large airship.\nSeamanship/TL: The skill of operating anchors, hatches, mooring lines, pumps, sails, windlasses, etc. aboard a large surface ship (but not a submarine).\nSpacer/TL: The skill of working with airlocks, docking clamps, hull patches, pressure doors, etc. on a large spacecraft or space base.\nSubmariner/TL: The skill of handling pressure doors, pumps, valves, etc. aboard a submarine or in an undersea base.",

A successful Traps roll will (among other things) disarm a trap once you have found it, reset it after you pass, or build a new trap (given suitable materials). Time required is as for Lockpicking (p. 206).\nTo detect a trap, make a Perception-based skill roll.\nNote that for the purposes of Traps skill, detection devices are 'traps.' Thus, this skill covers everything from covered pits to elaborate electronic security systems!",
  "skill-modifiers-traps": "Infinitely variable. The more sophisticated the trap, the harder it will be to disarm, reset, build, or find – and a given trap might be (for instance) easy to find but hard to disarm. The GM should be creative! Equipment modifiers (p. 345) apply to most rolls to set or disarm traps. Bonuses for Acute Vision (p. 35) apply to rolls to detect traps (only).",
  "skill-description-force-whip": "A whip is a flexible weapon made from a length of chain, leather, wire, etc. A whip can be up to seven yards long – but note that a whip two yards or more in length cannot strike at one yard or closer, and is slow to ready after an attack. A whip tends to wind around its target, making it an excellent disarming and entangling weapon. However, a whip’s lack of rigidity makes it a poor parrying weapon. For details, see Special Melee Weapon Rules (p. 404).\nAny whip made of pure energy instead of matter. These are usually ultra-tech devices that project energy from a powered hilt, but magical or psi-tech versions are possible. Most force whips can lash the target but not ensnare him.",

  "skill-description-criminology": "This is the study of crime and the criminal mind. A successful skill roll allows you to find and interpret clues, guess how criminals might behave, etc. Though this skill does not actually default to Streetwise, the GM might allow a Streetwise roll instead in certain situations – especially to predict or outguess a criminal.",
  "skill-description-flight": "This skill represents training for endurance flying. Use the better of Flight or HT when rolling to avoid fatigue due to flying. When traveling long distances, a successful Flight roll increases the distance traveled by 20%.

An astronomer could answer questions about the Sun, the planets of the solar system, etc. An amateur who can locate stars and use a telescope, but not perform involved calculations, has an optional specialty (p. 169): Astronomy (Observational). This specialty does not require Mathematics as a prerequisite.",
  "skill-description-machinist": "This is the skill of making and modifying mechanical parts and tools. A successful skill roll lets you build parts from raw materials, manufacture tools for use with another skill (such as Armoury or Lockpicking), or modify any simple mechanical device not explicitly covered by another skill. The GM may require an inventor to make one or more Machinist rolls before attempting an Engineer roll to assemble a gadget.\nMaterials and component size vary significantly with tech level. A TL5 machinist works mainly with brass and steel components that can be seen with the naked eye; a TL10 machinist might work with carbon nanotubes.",
  "skill-description-shadowing": "This is the ability to follow another person through a crowd without being noticed. (In the wilderness, use Tracking and Stealth.) Roll a Quick Contest every 10 minutes: your Shadowing vs. the subject’s Vision roll. If you lose, you lost the subject; if you lose by more than 5, you were seen.\nOnce the subject is aware you are shadowing him, roll a Quick Contest every five minutes: your Shadowing skill vs. his Shadowing or Stealth skill. If he wins, he eludes you. If he loses by more than 5, he thinks he eluded you. If you critically fail, you lose him and follow the wrong person.\nFollowing someone in a vehicle is harder than shadowing on foot. Use the same rules, but you roll at -2 (and may not use your Stealth default).",
  "skill-modifiers-shadowing": "-3 if the subject knows you. Distinctive appearance gives a penalty – see Build (p. 18), Unnatural Features (p. 22), and specific disadvantages (e.g., Hunchback, p. 139) for details. If you belong to a visibly different race than most of the people around you, the penalty is up to the GM; it is never smaller in magnitude than the difference between your Size Modifier and that of those around you.",
  "skill-description-research": "This is the ability to do library and file research. Roll against skill to find a useful piece of data in an appropriate place of research ... if the information is there to be found.\nAt the GM’s option, when researching material connected with a 'book-learned' skill such as Forensics, Literature, or Physics, you may roll against that skill at -2 instead, if that would be better than your Research skill or default (but this is not a general default level).",
  "skill-description-hypnotism": "This is the skill of inducing a suggestible state in another person through verbal or mechanical means. It requires five seconds and a successful skill roll to use. If you fail on a cooperative subject, you may try again. The second attempt takes five minutes, and the roll is at -5. If this attempt fails, you may not try to hypnotize the subject again that day.\nA successful Hypnotism attempt puts the subject to sleep. This counts as an anesthetic for the purpose of Surgery. At the GM’s option, further Hypnotism rolls might help the subject remember something he had forgotten, while Psychology rolls might help him get over mental problems.\nA hypnotized individual is extremely suggestible. Roll a Quick Contest of Hypnotism vs. the victim’s Will for each suggestion. The subject resists suggestions that threaten his life or his loved ones, or that go strongly against his character, at +5. You may also give 'posthypnotic suggestions,' instructing the subject to do something in response to a trigger after the hypnosis ends. The subject’s resistance roll for such suggestions takes place when he encounters the trigger. He resists at +1 to Will per week since he was hypnotized.\nYou cannot use Hypnotism as an attack, except in highly cinematic games. You can use it on an unaware or unwilling subject out of combat, but he resists at Will+5. If he resists the initial attempt, he is considered uncooperative, and you may not make a second attempt that day. A subject who is unfamiliar with Hypnotism might not know what you attempted, but he suspects something – possibly witchcraft!\nIn all cases, a hypnotic trance lasts 1d hours unless you end it sooner.",

If your Mount skill exceeds your rider’s Riding level, he may use the average of the two skills (round up) whenever he must make a Riding roll. If you have any points in this skill, your rider gets a minimum +1 to skill. To throw an unwelcome rider, win Quick Contest of Mount vs. his Riding skill.",
  "skill-description-poetry": "This is the ability to compose 'good' poetry of any type native to your culture, in any language you know. A successful roll lets you write one good poem in an appropriate amount of time (GM’s decision). A failed roll might mean that you couldn’t get inspired – or that your audience just didn’t care for your work (for whatever reason).",
  "skill-description-monowire-whip": "A whip is a flexible weapon made from a length of chain, leather, wire, etc. A whip can be up to seven yards long – but note that a whip two yards or more in length cannot strike at one yard or closer, and is slow to ready after an attack. A whip tends to wind around its target, making it an excellent disarming and entangling weapon. However, a whip’s lack of rigidity makes it a poor parrying weapon.

  "skill-description-merchant": "This is the skill of buying, selling, and trading retail and wholesale goods. It involves bargaining, salesmanship, and an understanding of trade practices. It covers all types of merchandise, but many merchants have an optional specialty (p. 169) in a single class of goods.\nMake a skill roll to judge the value of any piece of common goods, find out where any commodity is bought and sold, find the local fair market value of any commodity, etc.\nWhen two merchants haggle, the GM may settle it with a Quick Contest. The winner adds or subtracts 10% of fair value, depending on whether he was trying to sell or buy.\nIf you have this skill at any level, you get +1 on reaction rolls when buying or selling. If you have this skill at level 20 or better, you get +2.",

A successful Prospecting roll lets you locate minerals, judge good ore from a small sample (and gauge its commercial value), and find water by using an 'eye for country,' as described for Survival skill (p. 223).\nThis skill is 'applied geology,' and requires on-site examination. Prospecting from a distance – using maps, instrument readings, and extrapolation – uses Geology skill instead.",
  "skill-description-lasso": "This is the skill of throwing the lariat: a long rope or thong with a sliding noose at one end. Its intended purpose is to snare animals, but it can also entangle opponents in combat – see Special Ranged Weapons (p. 410).",

Roll once per hour of begging.\nOn a success, you net $2.00 times your margin of success. On a critical success, you get some sort of unexpected bonus – perhaps someone buys you dinner or gives you a useful or saleable item (e.g., a raincoat or a new pair of shoes). On a failure, you receive nothing. On a critical failure, you are assaulted or have a run-in with the law.",
  "skill-description-lance": "The ability to use the lance: a long, spear-like weapon wielded from horseback. This is not a Melee Weapon skill (see p. 208). You may not use a lance to parry – you must block or dodge enemy attacks.",
  "skill-description-shortsword": "A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.\nAny balanced, one-handed weapon 1-2 feet in length – including the shortsword and any club of comparable size and balance (e.g., a police baton). Defaults: Broadsword-2, Force Sword-4, Jitte/Sai-3, Knife-4, Saber-4, Smallsword-4, or Tonfa-3.",
  "skill-description-skating": "When you are moving on skates, this skill replaces Hiking skill (p. 200) for routine travel and Running skill (p. 218) for racing. The GM may also require DX-based skill rolls in combat or chases, or for hazardous maneuvers, conditions, or speeds. Under those circumstances, any failure indicates a fall, while critical failure results in 1d-2 damage to a randomly chosen limb.",
  "skill-description-freight-handling": "This is the skill of supervising the loading and unloading of vehicles (laborers do not require this skill – just their foreman). A successful skill roll cuts the time required by 20%. Also roll against Freight Handling skill any time there is doubt as to whether an item of cargo was lost or damaged; on a success, it made the journey intact.",
  "skill-description-paleontology-paleobotany": "Study of ancient plant life and fossils through paleobotanical evidence.",
  "skill-description-cooking": "This is the skill of being a chef – you do not need it to heat water and open boxes, or to cook rat-on-a-stick over your campfire.

Many chefs have an optional specialty (p. 169), such as baking, beverage making, or a particular variety of ethnic cuisine (e.g., Chinese or Martian).",
  "skill-description-hidden-lore-demon-lore": "Knowledge of demons, infernal beings, and supernatural entities associated with evil.",
  "skill-description-body-control": "This ability lets you affect involuntary bodily functions such as heart rate, blood flow, and digestion. One use of this skill is to enter a deathlike trance, during which only those who can win a Quick Contest of Diagnosis vs. your Body Control skill even realize that you are alive. This requires (30 - skill) seconds of concentration, minimum one second.\nYou can also use this skill to flush poisons from your body. To do so, you must first roll against Poisons (or Alchemy, Pharmacy, etc., as appropriate) to identify the poison. You cannot attempt this roll until you know you have been poisoned. In most cases, you only discover this when the first symptoms show! A successful Body Control roll – adjusted by any modifier to the HT roll to resist the poison – flushes the poison in 1d hours, after which it has no further effect. Finally, you may use the higher of this skill and basic HT to resist any Affliction, magic spell, or psionic attack that is normally resisted by HT.",
  "skill-description-broadsword": "A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.\nAny balanced, 2 to 4-foot blade wielded in one hand – broadsword, cavalry saber, scimitar, etc. This skill also covers any stick or club of similar size and balance to these blades, as well as bastard swords, katanas, and longswords used one-handed. Defaults: Force Sword-4, Rapier-4, Saber-4, Shortsword-2, or Two-Handed Sword-4.",

  "skill-description-administration": "This is the skill of running a large organization. It is often a prerequisite for high Rank (p. 29). A successful Administration roll gives you a +2 reaction bonus when dealing with a bureaucrat, and allows you to predict the best way to go about dealing with a bureaucracy.",
  "skill-description-falconry": "This is the skill of 'hawking': hunting small game with a trained hawk. It includes knowledge of hunting and training techniques, as well as how to care for a falcon. Finding a wild falcon’s nest in spring requires a week’s search and a successful Falconry roll; a nest has 1d-3 chicks.",
  "skill-description-interrogation": "This is the ability to question a prisoner. Only intelligence agencies, police and prison services, the military, and the underworld teach this skill.\nRoll a Quick Contest of Interrogation vs. the prisoner’s Will for each question. This requires 5 minutes per question. If you win, you get a truthful answer. If you tie or lose, the victim remains silent or lies. If you lose by more than five points, he tells you a good, believable lie! The GM roleplays the prisoner (or, if you are the prisoner, the GM will roleplay the interrogator) and makes all die rolls in secret.\n* 'Torture' does not necessarily mean thumbscrews and the rack. Exposing a prisoner to the object of his phobia (see Phobias, p. 148) is an effective torture, as is a believable threat against a loved one. Note that torturing a prisoner is usually considered vile behavior, likely bringing retribution.",
  "skill-description-intelligence-analysis": "This is the ability to analyze and interpret intelligence data. It allows you to deduce enemy plans and capabilities, evaluate the accuracy of information, rate the reliability of sources, etc. In most game worlds, only intelligence, military, and security services teach this skill – often only to those with a minimum level of Rank or Security Clearance.\nThe GM makes all Intelligence Analysis rolls in secret. On a success, he provides details about the significance and accuracy of your data, or insights into what it means in terms of enemy planning. When you encounter deliberately falsified data, the GM rolls a secret Quick Contest: your Intelligence Analysis vs. the enemy’s skill at disinformation (Forgery, Propaganda, etc.). If you win, the GM provides details on precisely what is wrong with the information. It is up to you to deduce what this means, however!\nThis skill has nothing to do with gathering intelligence. Use Current Affairs (p.186) and Research (p. 217) to sift through public sources; Forensics (p. 196) and Search (p. 219) to find physical clues; Observation (p. 211) for human surveillance; and Electronics Operation (p. 189) to work with the satellite imagery, communications intercepts, and related 'technical means' common at TL7+.\nYou may take an optional specialty (p. 169) in one particular type of intelligence. A useful specialty at TL6+ is Intelligence Analysis (Traffic Analysis): identifying the purpose and organization of targets by examining intercepted communications traffic.",
  "skill-description-first-aid": "This is the ability to patch up an injury in the field (see Recovery, p. 423). Make a skill roll to halt bleeding, suck out poison, give artificial respiration to a drowning victim, etc. Unusual problems must be identified using Diagnosis skill first.",
  "skill-description-archaeology": "This is the study of ancient civilizations. An archaeologist is at home with excavations, old potsherds, inscriptions, etc. An Archaeology roll lets you answer questions about ancient history, or identify artifacts and dead languages. It might even reveal information relating to the occult; e.g., Ancient Secrets and Things Man Was Not Meant To Know...",
  "skill-description-forced-entry": "This is the ability to kick in doors and windows, or demolish them with a crowbar, ram, or sledgehammer, without necessarily being adept at melee combat. Make a skill roll to hit an inanimate object with your foot or an impact weapon. Add +1 per die to basic thrust or swing damage if you have this skill at DX+1, +2 per die if you know it at DX+2 or better. Add a similar bonus (+1 or +2) to ST rolls made for forced entry. The damage bonus also applies when you use Melee Weapon skills to wreck inanimate objects out of combat.\nFor subtle break-ins, use Lockpicking skill (p. 206).",
  "skill-description-two-handed-flail": "A flail is any flexible, unbalanced weapon with its mass concentrated in the head. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn. Because flails tend to wrap around the target’s shield or weapon, attempts to block them are at -2 and attempts to parry them are at -4. Fencing weapons and knives cannot parry them at all! An unarmed fighter can parry a flail, but at -4 in addition to any penalty for parrying unarmed.",
  "skill-description-chemistry": "This is the study of matter. A chemist can identify elements and simple compounds (but not necessarily drugs, magical substances, etc.). Given proper equipment, he could conduct complex analyses and syntheses.",
  "skill-description-breath-control": "This is the ability to breathe at maximum efficiency. On a successful skill roll, you can increase the time you can hold your breath for any reason (e.g., underwater) by 50%, or regain one FP in only two minutes (you cannot combine this with magic spells that restore FP).",
  "skill-description-dancing": "This is the ability to perform dances appropriate to your own culture, and to learn new dances quickly. Note that certain physical handicaps make this skill effectively impossible!\nExotic dances abound in fiction and history: blade dancing, bull dancing, fire dancing, snake dancing, etc. The GM may decide that each is a separate DX/Average skill that defaults to Dancing-5.",
  "skill-description-thaumatology": "This is the academic study of magical theory and the 'physics' of mana. Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells.\nThe main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide.\nThis is the study of fantasy magic – fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to 'standard' wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!",
  "skill-description-dreaming": "This is the skill of controlling and remembering your dreams. A successful skill roll lets you experience vivid dreams about a subject of your choosing. Use the Fortune-Telling (Dream Interpretation) skill to interpret your dreams. In some game worlds, this might be a useful divinatory technique (GM’s decision).\nA Dreaming roll can also help you recall a previously forgotten piece of information, or something you witnessed but did not consciously note. This technique is much less reliable than Eidetic Memory (p. 51), though. The GM will describe your dreams to you, working clues into the narrative. It is up to you, the player, to spot these hints!\nFinally, you can use this skill to combat malign supernatural influences on your dreams. Resolve this as a Quick Contest between your Dreaming skill and your harasser’s skill at dream control. If you win, you shut out the external influence.",

  "skill-description-savoir-faire-servant": "Knowledge and etiquette for serving in domestic or service-oriented roles.",
  "skill-description-sewing": "This is the ability to work with fabric using the tools of your tech level. A successful skill roll lets you repair damaged clothing (or any other item made of cloth), modify garments (useful when you must wear another person’s clothing, perhaps to impersonate him), or create new clothing or costumes from suitable materials.\nMake an IQ-based roll to design clothing, at +1 if you have Fashion Sense (p. 21).\nBefore TL7, someone knows this skill in almost every household. At TL7+, it is rare for anyone but a professional seamstress or tailor to know Sewing – most people work at default (at +4 for a simple task like reattaching a button) and discard items that they cannot mend.",
  "skill-modifiers-sewing": "Equipment modifiers (p. 345); modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138).",
  "skill-description-counterfeiting": "This is the art of duplicating bank-notes and coins. It is only taught by the underworld and government agencies (although this is rare outside of rogue states, except in wartime). Time required varies from days to weeks (GM’s option). The GM secretly rolls against your Counterfeiting skill for each 'batch' of money.\nA critical success means that the fakes in that batch are as good as the real thing.\nAn ordinary success means that your work is good but not perfect. Whenever you try to pass the counterfeit money, the GM makes a second skill roll for you, with all the same modifiers. If this roll fails, the recipient spots your handiwork. To successfully pass bogus currency to someone who has reason to be suspicious, you must win a Quick Contest of Counterfeiting vs. the highest of his Perception, Forensics, and Merchant.\nAny failure on the initial Counterfeiting roll means that the first person to receive the money immediately realizes that it is bogus. Critical failure – on the initial roll or any subsequent roll – has other ramifications: the recipient is an undercover cop, an armed and angry citizen, etc.",
  "skill-description-parachuting": "This is the ability to survive a parachute jump. Roll once per jump. Failure could mean anything from drifting off course to panic that makes you drop your gear (GM’s option). A critical failure means the chute did not open or was fatally fouled (see Falling, p. 431). For a jump under bad conditions, make a second roll on landing – for instance, to survive an 'ankle-breaker' landing without injury, or to dodge trees on the way down. Make an IQ-based roll to pack a parachute.",
  "skill-description-weird-science": "This skill allows you to formulate astonishing new crackpot scientific theories that are far ahead of their time ... or at least utterly different from the usual assumptions of your tech level. You may attempt a Weird Science roll whenever you work on a new invention (see Chapter 17) or investigate an existing item of weird technology (e.g., a UFO).\nOn a success, you get +5 on an invention attempt (but only +1 if using the Gadgeteer advantage, since Gadgeteer already gives you favorable die rolls for thinking 'outside the box'). If investigating weird technology, success gives +2 to any skill roll you make for this purpose – and the GM might even allow a default skill roll to operate the device!\nOn a critical success, you get these bonuses and some incredible insight into a totally different problem! Critical failures are always spectacular, although not necessarily fatal or even dangerous.",
  "skill-description-stealth": "This is the ability to hide and to move silently. A successful roll lets you conceal yourself anywhere except in a totally bare room, or move so quietly that nobody will hear you, or follow someone without being noticed. (To follow someone through a crowd, use Shadowing, p. 219.)\nIf someone is specifically on the alert for intruders, the GM will roll a Quick Contest between your Stealth and the sentinel’s Perception.\nYou can also use this skill to stalk game. A successful roll (and about 30 minutes) gets you within 30 yards of most animals. Another roll, at -5, gets you within 15 yards.",
  "skill-modifiers-stealth": "A penalty equal to your encumbrance level. -5 to hide in an area without 'natural' hiding places, or +3 or more if there are many hiding places. -5 to move silently if you are moving faster than Move 1. -5 to fool those with Discriminatory Smell (e.g., dogs).",

  "skill-description-persuade": "This ability allows you to bring an audience over to your point of view, granting you a bonus to your reaction rolls with them. You may use this skill whenever a reaction roll is called for.\nIf you win the Quick Contest, add your margin of victory to any reaction roll those in the audience make regarding you – for any reason – to a maximum of +3 (+4 on a critical success). If you critically fail, the best possible reaction is Poor (see p. 560).\nTime: 1 minute.\nFatigue Cost: 2 FP, whether successful or not.\nDuration: Until you do something to change the audience’s opinion!",
  "skill-description-bone-carving": "Skill in carving, shaping, or crafting objects from bone material.",

  "skill-description-masonry": "This is the ability to build things out of brick or stone.",
  "skill-description-public-speaking": "This is general talent with the spoken word. A successful skill roll lets you (for instance) give a good political speech, entertain a group around a campfire, incite or calm a riot, or put on a successful 'court jester' act\nPublic Speaking includes skill with debate, oratory, and rhetoric, as well as ability with less formal activities such as 'punning' and storytelling. Not all speakers possess talent in all of these areas. You may take an optional specialty (p. 169) to represent this.",
  "skill-description-flying-leap": "This skill allows you to make incredible leaps. It costs 1 FP per attempt, successful or not.\nOn a success, you may immediately attempt a jump. Use the standard jumping rules (see Jumping, p. 352), but triple your jumping distance. On a failure, you may still attempt the jump, but you receive no bonus and make all jumping-related rolls at -5. On a critical failure, you fall down!\nYou may use Flying Leap to jump into someone as part of an attack. Such attacks are at an extra -2 to hit, but if you do hit, triple your ST for damage and knockback purposes. In a slam or collision, calculate Move from jumping distance as described for Super Jump (p. 89), and use this velocity to calculate damage.",
  "skill-description-herb-lore": "This is the ability to manufacture herbal concoctions that have magical effects – healing balms, love potions, etc. It only exists in magical game worlds, where it functions much as Alchemy skill (p. 174). Unlike Alchemy, Herb Lore does not include the ability to analyze 'elixirs.' On the other hand, an expert at this skill can locate magical ingredients for free in the wild by making a few Naturalist rolls, while an alchemist requires rare and expensive materials (such as alkahest, dragon’s blood, gemstones, and gold) to do his work.",
  "skill-description-speed-reading": "This is the ability to read much faster than normal. Whenever time is of the essence (for instance, when reading the instructions on a parachute as you fall), multiply your reading speed by a factor of 1 + (skill/10); e.g., Speed-Reading-12 would give a factor of 2.2. Make a skill roll to determine whether you retain what you have read.\nOn a failure, your recall is shaky. Every time you try to remember or use what you read, you must make an IQ roll at a penalty equal to your margin of failure. Roll at +5 if you have Eidetic Memory, or +10 for Photographic Memory. If this roll fails, you cannot recall the information; on a critical failure, you recall badly flawed information but believe it to be true! To eliminate this IQ roll, you must go back and reread the material slowly.",
  "skill-modifiers-speed-reading": "Language modifiers (p. 24).",
  "skill-description-diplomacy": "This is the skill of negotiating, compromising, and getting along with others. You may substitute a Diplomacy roll for any reaction roll in a noncombat situation, as described under Influence Rolls (p. 359).\nUnlike other Influence skills, Diplomacy never gives a worse result than if you had tried an ordinary reaction roll. Failure with Fast-Talk or Sex Appeal alienates the subject, but Diplomacy is usually safe.\nA successful roll also allows you to predict the possible outcome of a course of action when you are negotiating, or to choose the best approach to take.\nIf you know Diplomacy at level 20 or better, you get a +2 bonus on all reaction rolls!",
  "skill-modifiers-diplomacy": "Low empathy: -3\nOblivious: -1\nShyness: -1 to -4\nStuttering: -2\nUnfamiliar with the culture: -3",

Brawling can also replace DX when you attack with teeth, claws, horns, or other 'natural weapons.'\nBrawling improves damage: if you know Brawling at DX+2 level or better, add +1 per die to basic thrust damage when you calculate damage with Brawling attacks – punches, kicks, claws, bites, etc. Work out damage ahead of time and record it on your character sheet.\nBrawling includes the ability to use the blackjack or sap. An attack with such a fist load is considered a punch at +1 to damage.\nWhen you defend with bare hands, Brawling allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Brawling parries are at -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks. For more on barehanded parries, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376).",
  "skill-description-tactics": "This is the ability to outguess and outmaneuver the enemy in small-unit or personal combat. In most settings, only the military teaches this skill.\nWhen commanding a small unit, roll against Tactics to place your troops correctly for an ambush, know where to post sentries, etc. At the GM’s option, a successful roll might even provide clues as to immediate enemy plans. To outmaneuver enemy units, you must win a Quick Contest of Tactics with their leader. All of this only applies when you lead a group small enough that you can give each warrior orders personally – or through at most one subordinate. Thus, radio and similar technologies can greatly enhance your command abilities!\nIn personal combat, you may make a Tactics roll before the fight begins if you had any time to prepare. On a success, you start the fight in an advantageous position – e.g., behind cover or on higher ground – as determined by the GM. The better the roll, the greater your advantage. If you fail, or do not attempt a Tactics roll, you are in a random location (or one of the GM’s choosing) when combat begins. Fighters without Tactics skill always start combat this way.\nEven in an ambush or similar 'surprise' situation, the GM will use the better of your Tactics skill and your Perception to see if you spotted the danger on time.",
  "skill-description-hazardous-materials": "This is the skill of transporting, storing, and disposing of hazardous materials ('HazMat'). It includes preparing the records that accompany HazMat shipments; applying and identifying warning labels and markings; and knowledge of countermeasures, antidotes, and containment and decontamination procedures. (To operate personal protective gear, use the NBC Suit skill, p. 192.)\nYou must specialize by type of HazMat. Common specialties are Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive, but more exotic options (e.g., Magical or Nanotech) may exist in some settings. Mundane specialties default to one another at -5; exotic specialties often have no default at all.\nWhenever you deal with HazMat in any capacity, roll against the lower of the skill used for the task (Driving, Freight Handling, etc.) and the applicable Hazardous Materials specialty or default. Note that the IQ-5 default represents any layman’s knowledge of household hazards. HazMat professionals deliberately keep certain aspects of this skill (notably HazMat markings) obscure to avoid alarming the general public. The default does not apply when dealing with such things.",
  "skill-description-gunner": "This is the ability to use a heavy weapon, usually one mounted on a tripod or a vehicle, to make a direct-fire attack – that is, to aim and fire at a target to which you have a line of sight. For indirect fire, use Artillery skill (p. 178). Roll against Gunner skill to hit the target.\nMake an IQ-based skill roll to take immediate action (e.g., clear a stoppage or restart a crashed targeting computer), should your weapon fail. Loaders can make ST-based skill rolls to improve the rate of fire of certain crew-served weapons; see individual weapon descriptions for details.\nYou must specialize by weapon type. The available specialties vary by TL, but include one or more of:\nBeams: Any kind of heavy directed-energy weapon: laser, particle beam, etc.\nCannon: Any kind of heavy projectile weapon – e.g., the main gun of a tank or an ultra-tech railgun on a starship – that fires single shots.\nCatapult: Any kind of large, directfire mechanical bolt-thrower, such as a ballista.\nMachine Gun: Any kind of heavy projectile weapon capable of firing bursts.\nRockets: Any kind of free-flight rocket fired from a mount.\nThese specialties default to one another at -4. The weapons covered by each specialty vary by TL. For instance, Gunner (Machine Gun) covers hand-cranked Gatling guns at TL5, automatic machine guns at TL6, auto-cannon at TL7, and electromagnetic machine guns at TL9+.\nFamiliarity is crucial here! Gunner/TL7 (Machine Gun) covers both tripod-mounted machine guns and aircraft autocannon, but going from one to the other gives you -2 for weapon type (machine gun to auto-cannon), -2 for aiming system (open sights to HUD), and -2 for mount (tripod to hull mount), for a net -6 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences.",
  "skill-description-geography": "This is the study of the physical, political, and economic divisions of a planet, and how they interact. It is part physical science, part social science. You must specialize:\nPhysical: The study of the physical properties of a planetary surface. A physical geographer could answer questions about climate, terrain, and so forth. You must further specialize by planet type; see Planet Types (p. 180). Defaults: Geology (same planet type)-4 or Meteorology (same planet type)-4.\nPolitical: The study of political regions – their borders, natural resources, industries, etc. A political geographer could answer questions about land claims, overpopulation, regional economic disparities, transportation networks, etc. Default: Economics-4.\nRegional: The study of all of the above, but specific to a single region: New York, the United States, planet Earth, etc. The depth of knowledge decreases with the size of the region (see Area Knowledge, p. 176). Default: the relevant Area Knowledge skill at -6.\nThese specialties default among themselves at -5.",
  "skill-description-connoisseur": "This skill represents an educated understanding of art and luxury items. It is vital to art dealers, critics, master thieves, and anyone who wishes to appear cultured. A successful roll lets you predict what critics will think of a piece of art, assess how much it will fetch on the market (+1 to Merchant skill when trading it), or impress the culturally literate (may give +1 to Savoir-Faire or reaction rolls, at the GM’s option).\nYou must specialize. Specialties include Dance, Literature, Music, Visual Arts, and Wine. Each specialty defaults to skills used to study or create the art at -3: Connoisseur (Literature) defaults to Literature, Poetry, or Writing at -3; Connoisseur (Music) defaults to Group Performance (Conducting), Musical Composition, or Musical Instrument at -3; and so on.",
  "skill-modifiers-connoisseur": "Lack of a Cultural Familiarity may give a penalty to Connoisseur\nKilljoy gives -3",
  "skill-description-biology": "This is the scientific study of the structure, behavior, and habitats of living organisms. You must specialize in the life of a particular planet type (see box). If you do not specify a planet type, your native planet type is assumed. The IQ default applies only to the planet type you grew up on. The default between different planet-type specialties is -4.\nAt TL6+, most biologists have an optional specialty (p. 169) as well. The most common options are biochemistry (the study of the chemical reactions that sustain life), botany (the study of plants), ecology (the study of environments), genetics (the study of heredity and genomes), marine biology (the study of ocean life), microbiology (the study of microscopic organisms), and zoology (the study of animals), but more obscure specialties are possible.",
  "skill-description-survival": "This is the ability to 'live off the land,' find safe food and water, avoid hazards, build shelter, etc. You may look after up to 10 other people. To live safely in a wilderness situation, you must make a successful Survival roll once per day. Failure inflicts 2d-4 injury on you and anyone in your care; roll separately for each victim.\nThis skill also gives an 'eye for country.' A successful roll shows you the best direction of travel to find flowing water, a mountain pass, or whatever other terrain feature you desire – assuming that it exists.\nFinally, you can use this skill to trap wild animals. (A city-bred thief could use Traps skill, but he’s used to different game ... so the roll would beat a -5.) Make one roll per trap. It takes about 30 minutes to improvise a trap from ordinary materials, or 10 minutes to set and hide a commercial steel trap. Pit traps for large game take several hours to dig.\nSurvival often requires skill rolls based on scores other than Perception. The GM might ask for a ST-based roll to dig a pit trap or erect a log shelter, a DX-based roll to start a fire using primitive techniques (flint sparking, bow and palette, etc.), or even a HT-based roll to avoid nutritional deficiencies from an improvised diet.\nYou must specialize by terrain type. Land-dwellers may choose from Arctic, Desert, Island/Beach, Jungle, Mountain, Plains, Swampland, and Woodlands. Aquatic beings may take any of Bank, Deep Ocean Vent, Fresh-Water Lake, Open Ocean, Reef, River/Stream, Salt-Water Sea, and Tropical Lagoon. Amphibious individuals can pick from either list!\nLand specialties default to one another at -3, while aquatic specialties default among themselves at -4. Island/Beach and Tropical Lagoon default to each other at -4, as do Swampland and River/Stream, but there are no other defaults between land and aquatic specialties.\nIn settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must also specialize by planet. Each Survival specialty defaults to the same terrain type for a different planet at -4. The defaults between terrain types given above are at an extra -4 between different planets. All this assumes the two planets are of the same planet type (see Planet Types, p. 180). There is no default at all between Survival skills for two planets of different planet types.\nAt the GM’s option, extreme man-made terrain may call for unique specialties; e.g., Survival (Radioactive Wasteland). Most such specialties have no default of any kind.\nSee also Urban Survival, p. 228.",
  "skill-modifiers-survival": "Up to -5 for extreme weather conditions. Equipment modifiers (p. 345).",
  "skill-description-area-knowledge": "This skill represents familiarity with the people, places, and politics of a given region. You usually have Area Knowledge only for the area you consider your 'home base,' whether that’s a single farm or a solar system. If information about other areas is available, the GM may allow you to learn additional Area Knowledge skills.\nThe GM should not require Area Knowledge rolls for ordinary situations; e.g., to find the blacksmith, tavern, or your own home. But he could require a roll to locate a smith to shoe your horse at 3 a.m., or to find the best ambush spot along a stretch of road. 'Secret' or obscure information might give a penalty, require a Hidden Lore skill (p. 199), or simply be unavailable – GM’s decision. For instance, Area Knowledge of Washington, D.C. gives you the location of the Russian Embassy, but not the KGB’s current safe house.\nThe information covered by Area Knowledge often overlaps such skills as Current Affairs, Geography, Naturalist, and Streetwise. The difference is that Area Knowledge works for a single area: you know the habits of this tiger or gang boss, but have no special insight into tigers or gangs in general.\nYou can learn Area Knowledge for any sort of area. The larger the territory, the less 'personal' and more general your knowledge becomes. Almost everyone will have Area Knowledge of some type. The 'canonical' area classes are:\nNeighborhood: For an urban area: the residents and buildings of a few city blocks. For a rural area: the inhabitants, trails, streams, hiding places, ambush sites, flora, and fauna of a few hundred acres.\nVillage or Town: All important citizens and businesses, and most unimportant ones; all public buildings and most houses.\nCity: All important businesses, streets, citizens, leaders, etc.\nBarony, County, Duchy, or Small Nation: General nature of its settlements and towns, political allegiances, leaders, and most citizens of Status 5+.\nLarge Nation: Location of its major cities and important sites; awareness of its major customs, ethnic groups, and languages (but not necessarily expertise); names of folk of Status 6+; and a general understanding of the economic and political situation.\nPlanet: As for a large nation, but more general; knowledge of people of Status 7+ only.\nInterplanetary State: Location of major planets; familiarity with all known races (but not necessarily expertise); knowledge of people of Status 7+; general understanding of the economic and political situation.\nGalaxy: Location of the capitals of interplanetary states and the homeworlds of major races; general awareness of all major races; knowledge of individuals of Status 8; general understanding of relations between interplanetary states.\nArea Knowledge for anything larger than a galaxy would be meaninglessly vague.\nYour IQ-4 default applies to any of these classes, as long as you have lived in the area. Defaults are limited by 'common knowledge' at your tech level! A TL0 hunter would have a default for every level up to 'Village or Town,' while a TL8 student would have defaults up to 'Planet' level. You must live in an interplanetary or inter-stellar state to have defaults for levels above 'Planet.'\nIn some game worlds, Area Knowledge specialties may exist for parallel realities and other dimensions – Area Knowledge (Cyberspace), Area Knowledge (Dream Realms), etc. The knowledge such skills provide is left to the GM’s judgment.",
  "skill-description-sports": "This is the ability to play a particular sport well – perhaps well enough to earn a living. Each sport is a separate, Sports skill. Most Sports skills are DX/Average and default to DX-5, but those that put a premium on strength (e.g., rugby) might default to ST-5. Some Sports skills might default to one another or to other skills as well.\nMake an IQ-based roll to recall the basic rules of your sport. Detailed knowledge of the full rules governing leagues and tournaments – as would be expected of a coach or referee – is covered by the relevant Games skill (p. 197).\nThe GM may rule that certain Sports are useful in combat situations. For instance, Sports (Baseball) might let you use a bat to parry hurled rocks and grenades at (skill/2) + 3, Sports (Bullfighting) might give a Parry equal to (skill/2) + 3 against a slam by a beast that uses a 'running head butt,' and you might be able to roll against Sports (Rugby) to hit with a slam.",
  "skill-description-disguise": "This is the art of altering your appearance using clothing, makeup, and prosthetics. You do not need this skill to don a quick disguise – e.g., to put on a lab coat when you enter a laboratory – but such disguises only fool the inattentive! A good disguise requires a Disguise roll and 30 minutes to an hour of preparation.\nRoll a Quick Contest of Disguise skill vs. the Perception of each person your disguise must fool. Individuals with Criminology or Observation skill may substitute those skills for Perception when rolling to penetrate a disguise. The GM may allow other skills to be of use – for instance, Physician skill might help spot a rubber nose.\nWhen combining Acting (p. 174) with Disguise (that is, when you must change your face and your personality), you need only make one roll for each person or group – but it must be the harder of the two rolls.\nIf there is more than one sapient species in your world, you must specialize by race – Disguise (Human) is nothing like Disguise (Bug-Eyed Monster). Disguise specialized in your own species is the most common form; just list this as 'Disguise' on your character sheet. Disguise skills for physically similar species default to one another at -2 to -4.",
  "skill-description-thrown-weapon": "This is the ability to hurl any one type of thrown weapon. You must specialize:\nAxe/Mace: Any axe, hatchet, or mace balanced for throwing (but not an unbalanced battleaxe or maul!).\nDart: Any sort of small, finned dart. Games (Darts) defaults to this skill at no penalty. Default: Throwing-2.\nHarpoon: Any sort of tethered spear. Default: Thrown Weapon (Spear)-2.\nKnife: Any sort of knife.\nShuriken: Any sort of hiltless blade, notably shuriken ('ninja stars'). Default: Throwing-2.\nSpear: Any sort of spear, javelin, etc. Defaults: Spear Thrower-4 or Thrown Weapon (Harpoon)-2.\nStick: Any balanced and shaped throwing stick, such as a boomerang. This type of throwing stick does not return to the user.",
  "skill-description-shiphandling": "This is the ability to act as the master of a large vessel. It involves directing the crew in the tasks necessary to control the vehicle’s speed and direction. It also covers such duties as keeping the captain’s log and inspecting the crew. Someone with Shiphandling skill (at better than default!) should stand watch at all times when the vessel is underway. Roll vs. skill when encountering hazards or maneuvering for battle.\nA failed roll when encountering hazards means the vessel is damaged. This might mean anything from scratched paint to crippling damage that requires extensive repairs.\nA failed roll in battle means the vessel did not go exactly where intended. The details depend on the vessel, the tech level, and the GM’s judgment, but might include weapons being 'masked' (unable to engage the enemy), a failed boarding attempt, or drifting out of formation with your fleet (which might deny you the benefits of area defenses, fire support, or tactical communications).\nA critical failure under any circumstances means an appropriate disaster. Depending on the TL and situation, this could mean running aground, colliding with another vessel, being dismasted, losing your screws or rudder, or simply giving an order that your crew disregards. Whether they then save your ship for you, or mutiny and flee, is up to the GM.\nYou must specialize:\nAirship: Blimps, zeppelins, and similar large airships. Prerequisites: Airshipman, Leadership, and Navigation (Air). Defaults: Airshipman-5 or Piloting (Lighter-Than-Air)-5.\nShip: Surface vessels, from tug-boats to carriers.

  "skill-description-games": "This is the ability to play a game well. It includes knowledge of rules, etiquette, and tournament regulations. You must specialize in a particular game; possibilities include traditional board games (such as chess, Go, hnefatafl, and mankala), card games, war games, and computer games.\nMany cultures regard the ability to play one or more games skillfully as a worthwhile social accomplishment. People often stake vast sums on games, and it might be possible to earn a living as a professional gamer. Games may also be played to settle disputes. In a fantasy world, a powerful monster or wizard might even challenge a hero to a game – with his life or the lives of his companions at stake!\nKnowledge of the rules of a given sport is also a Games skill, but unlike other Games skills, sports specialties only allow you to judge an event. To play, learn the associated Sports (p. 222) or Combat Sport (p. 184) skill. As a referee, roll against skill to adjudicate a match, spot a subtle foul, determine the winner in a 'photo finish' situation, etc. As an athlete, you can use Games to make an Influence roll (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) when dealing with a referee or judge, but this use is always at -3 or worse.\nWhen you take a sports specialty, specify both the sport and the league or tournament type; e.g., Games (NFL Football) or Games (Olympic Judo).

If using this skill at default, also roll when you first enter the boat – to avoid falling in the water!\nYou must specialize:\nLarge Powerboat: Any boat with an enclosed cabin and an inboard motor. Includes cabin cruisers, houseboats, and patrol boats. Defaults: Motorboat-2, Sailboat-4, or Unpowered-4. This specialty (only) also defaults to Seamanship-4.\nMotorboat: Any open powerboat – notably speedboats and any of the boats used with the Sailboat or Unpowered specialty when outfitted with an outboard motor.

  "skill-description-law": "This skill represents knowledge of law codes and jurisprudence. A successful roll lets you remember, deduce, or figure out the answer to a question about the law. Few legal questions have clear-cut answers, however – even an expert will hedge his advice!\nYou must specialize. There are two general classes of specialty:\n• The laws of a particular political region (e.g., Canada or France) within a specific field (constitutional, contract, criminal, police, etc.). Examples: Law (British Criminal), Law (Canadian Constitutional), and Law (U.S. Contract).\n• A specialized body of law not associated with a political region. Examples: Law (Catholic Canon), Law (International), and Law (Space).\nSpecialties within the same region, such as Law (British Criminal) and Law (British Police), or field, such as Law (British Criminal) and Law (French Criminal), default to one another at -4. If both region and field differ, the default is -6 or worse.\nIn some times and places, a Quick Contest of Law (Criminal) between the defense and prosecution will determine the outcome of a trial. In others, Law functions as an Influence skill (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) used to sway the rulings of the judge.\nLaw enforcers nearly always have a point or two in Law (Police) for their region. This represents knowledge of 'proper procedure' when it comes to arrests, evidence handling, interrogation, etc.",

The systems covered by each specialty vary by TL. For instance, Mechanic (Light Airplane) covers single-engine biplanes at early TL6, small private jets at TL7, and so forth.\nFamiliarity is very important here. For instance, Mechanic/TL7 (Light Airplane) covers both propeller-powered seaplanes and small private jets, but going from one to the other gives you -2 for an unfamiliar item (proppowered plane to jet) and -2 for an unfamiliar implementation (seaplane to regular plane), for a net -4 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences.",
  "skill-description-savoir-faire": "This is the skill of appropriate behavior in a subculture that has an established code of conduct – for instance, high society or the military. When dealing with that social group, a successful skill roll lets you interact without embarrassing yourself, detect pretenders to high standing, and so on. You may also substitute an Influence roll against Savoir-Faire for any reaction roll required in a social situation involving that subculture; see Influence Rolls (p. 359). Roll once per encounter.\nYou must specialize. Common specialties include:\nDojo: How to greet masters, wear weapons, and issue challenges at a karate dojo, kung fu kwoon, fencing salle, or similar academy of the martial arts. Recognized skill determines relative standing. In certain places and times, to flout tradition is to risk violent retribution! For competitive martial arts (only), this skill defaults to any relevant Games skill at -3.\nHigh Society: The manners of those of 'good' birth and breeding. Status determines relative standing. Roll against skill whenever you must impersonate someone more than three Status levels away from your own. If your Status is negative and you are trying to pass yourself off as someone of Status 1+, or vice versa, this roll is at -2.\nMafia: Proper conduct within a formal criminal organization. This includes such things as codes of silence and showing proper deference to 'made men.' These protocols often ape those of high society ... but the penalties for misconduct are far more severe. Default: Streetwise-3.\nMilitary: The customs, traditions, and regulations of military service. This also includes knowledge of the unwritten rules: what is acceptable even if not regulation, and what is forbidden although there is nothing in writing against it. Military Rank determines relative standing.\nPolice: As Savoir-Faire (Military), but for civilian police service. This gives knowledge of the social protocols for police officers; use Law (Police) for the legal protocols. Police Rank determines relative standing.\nServant: Knowledge of how to serve the upper class. Certain procedures are always done just so (the salad fork goes outside the dinner fork, the Duke is announced before the Earl, etc.), and certain attitudes in a servant are unacceptable.\nSavoir-Faire (High Society) is the most common specialty, and you may list this as simply 'Savoir-Faire' on your character sheet. Savoir Faire (High Society) and (Servant) default to one another at -2. There are no defaults between other types of Savoir-Faire.",

Suitable props – star charts, tea leaves, etc. – can enhance the illusion. Knowledge of traditional occult or religious beliefs (especially those of your subject) can also lend an air of legitimacy.\nWith the GM’s permission, you can sometimes use Fortune-Telling in place of Fast-Talk (by making predictions that guide the subject toward a particular course of action), or Interrogation or Psychology (by asking the subject leading questions under the pretense of telling his fortune). This is only possible if the subject believes you are a genuine fortune-teller and you take the time to do a full 'reading' for him.\nYou must specialize in a particular mantic art. Available specialties include Astrology, Augury (interpretation of natural omens, such as flocks of birds), Crystal Gazing, Dream Interpretation, Feng Shui, Palmistry, and Tarot.\nThis skill is not a paranormal talent, and the GM is under no obligation to supply you with hints of future events. You might wish to learn this skill if you have actual divinatory abilities, though, as it enables you to present your predictions in a culturally acceptable way. 'I saw it in the stars' may be less likely to get you burned as a witch than 'I cast a spell'!",

See the appropriate weapon description for details.\nYou must specialize by weapon type. The available specialties vary by TL, but include one or more of:\nBeams: Any kind of heavy energy weapon that is fired from orbit, bounced off a mirror, or otherwise used against targets you cannot see.\nBombs: All kinds of unpowered, free-falling munitions.\nCannon: Any kind of heavy projectile weapon – bombard, howitzer, naval gun, etc.\nCatapult: Any kind of indirect-fire mechanical siege engine, such as a trebuchet.\nGuided Missile: Any kind of seeking or remotely piloted missile.\nTorpedoes: Any kind of powered underwater projectile.\nThere is no default between specialties, some of which (e.g., Torpedoes) cover weapons that bear little or no resemblance to true artillery. Artillery is a single skill only because all the weapons it covers use the same rules.\nThe weapons covered by each specialty will vary by TL. For instance, Artillery (Cannon) would cover primitive bombards at TL3, brass cannon at TL4, breech-loading howitzers at TL6, and orbital railguns at TL9+.\nFamiliarity is crucial here! Artillery (Cannon) covers both 81mm infantry mortars and 406mm naval guns, but going from one to the other will give -2 for weapon type (81mm vs. 406mm), -2 for fire-control (visual spotting vs. fire-direction center), and -2 for mount (bipod vs. naval turret), for a total of -6 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences.\nNote that Forward Observer skill (p. 196) is generally required to designate targets for Artillery skill.",
  "skill-description-geology": "This is the science dealing with the structure of planets – their crust, mantle, and core. A geologist knows about minerals, oil, ores, etc.; about earthquakes and volcanoes; and about fossils. In the field, he can attempt to find water by using an 'eye for country' (see Survival, p. 223).\nYou must specialize by planet type. See Planet Types (p. 180) for details.",
  "skill-description-driving": "This is the ability to drive a specific type of ground vehicle.\nMake an IQ-based Driving roll for basic map reading, to diagnose simple malfunctions, or to recall rules of the road.\nYou must specialize:\nAutomobile: Any vehicle with three or more wheels that weighs less than 5 tons and does not move on rails. Defaults: Heavy Wheeled-2 or other Driving at -4.\nConstruction Equipment: Any kind of bulldozer, crane, plow, etc. Default: other Driving at -5.\nHalftrack: Any vehicle that moves on tracks and either wheels or skids. Defaults: Tracked-2 or other Driving at -4.\nHeavy Wheeled: Any vehicle with three or more wheels that weighs 5 tons or more and does not move on rails. Defaults: Automobile-2 or other Driving at -4.\nHovercraft: Any kind of air-cushion vehicle. Default: other Driving at -5.\nLocomotive: Any vehicle that moves on conventional or maglev rails. Default: other Driving at -5.\nMecha: Any kind of legged, bouncing, rolling, or slithering vehicle. Defaults: Battlesuit-3 or other Driving at -5.\nMotorcycle: Any powered one or two-wheeled vehicle, including those with sidecars. Large motorcycles often have a Minimum ST, just like a weapon (see p. 270). Default: Bicycling-4.\nTracked: Any vehicle that moves on tracks. Defaults: Halftrack-2 or other Driving at -4.\nNote that the ability to 'drive' a team of animals is not Driving, but Teamster (p. 225).",
  "skill-description-artist": "This skill represents talent at a visual art. A successful roll might let you create a recognizable likeness of a person or an object, or a work beautiful enough to sell (the GM should not allow a default roll for this use!). Time required is up to the GM.\nArtist is based on IQ, but there are many situations in which the GM could logically ask for a DX-based roll, in which case modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138) would apply. In rare cases, even a ST-based Artist roll might make sense – for instance, to work with a physically tough material.\nYou must specialize in an art form. Common specialties include:\nBody Art: Tattooing, piercing, and scarification. Both this specialty and Painting suffice for henna or temporary tattoos, but cosmetic surgery requires Surgery skill (p. 223).\nCalligraphy: Beautiful and decorative handwriting. You need not be literate!\nDrawing: All forms of charcoal, ink, pastel, and pencil work.\nIllumination: Decorating written text with miniature paintings and pictures.\nIllusion: Creating believable or evocative illusions. Prerequisite: magical or psionic illusion ability of some kind.\nInterior Decorating: Creating pleasing building interiors by selecting appropriate paints, fixtures, and furniture. Default: Architecture-3.\nPainting: All forms of painting, whether on paper, canvas, or a wall, and whether with tempera, oil-based paint, or something more exotic (like blood).\nPottery: Working with various sorts of ceramics – especially clay.\nScene Design: Designing sets for the stage. Default: Architecture-3.\nSculpting: Creating three-dimensional art from ivory, stone, metal, etc.\nWoodworking: All forms of fine woodwork, including cabinet-making and decorative carving. Default: Carpentry-3.\nCalligraphy, Drawing, Illumination, and Painting default to one another at -2, and to or from Body Art at -4. Interior Decorating, Scene Design, and Woodworking default among themselves at -4. All other Artist specialties default to one another at -6.\nAn artist of any kind can take a further optional specialty (p. 169) in a particular medium or technique.\nMany Artist specialties are used to earn a living rather than to create fine art, and some people regard them as 'craft' skills, not 'art' skills. It is up to you whether you focus on beauty, realism, or functionality.",
  "skill-description-shield": "This is the ability to use a shield, both to block and to attack. Your active defense with any kind of shield – your Block score – is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. You must specialize:\nShield: Any shield held in place with straps. Such shields have the advantage that you can hold (but not wield) something in your shield hand, but the disadvantage of being slow to put on or take off. This is the most common specialty – list it as 'Shield' on character sheets.\nBuckler: Any kind of shield, usually a small one, held in the hand. A buckler occupies one hand completely, but you can ready it in only one turn and drop it as a free action.\nForce: Any shield with a blocking 'surface' formed from energy rather than matter.\nShield, Shield (Buckler), and Shield (Force) default to one another at -2.",
  "skill-description-armoury": "This is the ability to build, modify, and repair a specific class of weapons or armor. (It does not include skill at design; for that, see Engineer, p. 190.) A successful roll lets you find a problem, if it isn’t obvious; a second roll lets you repair it. Time required is up to the GM.\nYou must specialize in one of the following fields:\nBattlesuits: All kinds of powered armor, along with any built-in weaponry.\nBody Armor: Any kind of unpowered personal armor (but not shields). Also defaults to Smith (Bronze)-3 at TL1, to Smith (Iron)-3 at TL2-4, and to Machinist-3 at TL5+.\nForce Shields: Any kind of force screen or deflector – be it personal or vehicular. This is the same skill as Electronics Repair (Force Shields).\nHeavy Weapons: All weapons used with the Artillery and Gunner skills.\nMelee Weapons: Any weapon used with a Melee Weapon or Thrown Weapon skill, as well as all kinds of shields. Also defaults to Smith (Bronze)-3 at TL1, to Smith (Iron)-3 at TL2-4, and to Machinist-3 at TL5+.\nMissile Weapons: Man-portable, pre-gunpowder projectile weapons of all kinds – bows, crossbows, slings, etc.\nSmall Arms: All weapons used with the Beam Weapons and Guns skills. Also defaults to Machinist-5 at TL5+.\nVehicular Armor: All kinds of armored vehicle hulls.\nMost specialties default to one another at -4 – but above TL4, there is no default between Armoury specialties dealing with armor and Armoury specialties dealing with weapons. The technologies covered by each specialty vary with TL. For instance, Armoury (Small Arms) covers black-powder small arms at TL4, repeating small arms that fire cartridges at TL6, 'smart' infantry weapons at TL8, and portable beam weapons at TL10.\nThe GM should strictly enforce penalties for unfamiliarity. Armoury/TL10 (Small Arms) might cover both beam weapons and portable railguns, but going from one to the other gives you -2 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences.",
  "skill-description-symbol-drawing": "This is the art of scribing magical symbols. Depending on your magical tradition, you might carve these symbols with a ritual dagger, draw them on the ground or an altar using blood or ceremonial powders, write them in ink, trace them in the air with a wand or your fingers, or something else. You must specialize in a particular magical tradition.\nIn traditions where magical power flows from the caster, nature, spirits, etc. as opposed to the symbols themselves, the symbols provide a focus that aids magic use. Roll against Symbol Drawing before each ritual. On a success, add half your margin of success (round down) to your skill with the next ritual you conduct over the symbols. This kind of Symbol Drawing defaults to Ritual Magic (same)-4. For instance, Symbol Drawing (Voodoo) defaults to Ritual Magic (Voodoo)-4, and lets you draw the vevers used in Voodoo ritual.\nIn traditions where the symbols themselves imbue items or places (or even people, in the case of tattoos) with magic, the magic is only as good as the symbols. Roll against the lower of Symbol Drawing and your skill with the enchantment itself. This is most common in rune magic. Each runic alphabet is a separate Symbol Drawing skill with no default. For instance, Symbol Drawing (Futhark Runes) would let you scribe the runes used in Norse magic.\nMore-exotic traditions may have their own rules; see the appropriate worldbook for more information.",
  "skill-modifiers-symbol-drawing": "-1 or more if using non-traditional means to mark the symbols; -1 or more if placing the symbols on any surface other than those prescribed by your tradition.",
  "skill-description-piloting": "This is the ability to operate a specific type of aircraft or spacecraft. The default is to IQ, because it takes intelligence to figure out the controls in an emergency, but when you learn this skill, always base it on DX.\nRoll against Piloting for takeoffs and landings, and in any hazardous situation. Failure by 1 indicates a rough job; failure by more indicates damage to the vehicle. A critical failure is a crash! If you have skill 15+, a critical failure requires an immediate second roll. Only if the second roll is a failure does a mishap occur. Otherwise, it was a 'near thing,' averted by experience. Air combat requires frequent Piloting rolls as well.\nMake an IQ-based Piloting roll for basic map reading or practical meteorology, or to recall aviation laws and regulations.\nRemotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) use this skill if the pilot uses some form of telepresence to mimic actually being in the cockpit. Otherwise, make a DX-based roll against the appropriate skill for the task the RPV is performing (e.g., Forward Observer for a surveillance drone).\nYou must specialize:\nAerospace: Any vehicle capable of atmospheric flight to and from orbit. Defaults: High-Performance Airplane-2 or other Piloting at -4.\nAutogyro: Any rotor-equipped aircraft that uses its rotors for lift but not thrust. Defaults: Helicopter-3, any Airplane specialty at -4, or other Piloting at -5.\nContragravity: Any aircraft that relies on ultra-tech or magical levitation. Defaults: Vertol-3 or other Piloting at -5.\nFlight Pack: Any 'strap-on' aircraft. Defaults: Vertol-4 or other Piloting at -5.\nGlider: Any kind of unpowered, winged aircraft. Defaults: Light Airplane or Ultralight at -2, or other Piloting at -4.\nHeavy Airplane: Any winged aircraft weighing over 10 tons and flying at 600 mph or slower.

Defaults: Aerospace, Heavy Airplane, or Light Airplane at -2, or other Piloting at -4.\nHigh-Performance Spacecraft: Any space vehicle capable of accelerations of 0.1G or more. Defaults: Aerospace-4 or Low-Performance Spacecraft-2.\nLight Airplane: Any winged aircraft weighing 10 tons or less and flying at 600 mph or slower. Defaults: Glider, Heavy Airplane, High-Performance Airplane, or Ultralight at -2, or other Piloting at -4.\nLighter-Than-Air: Any kind of airship or balloon. Default: other Piloting at -5.\nLightsail: Any spacecraft that uses a lightsail, regardless of thrust. Default: Low-Performance Spacecraft-4.\nLow-G Wings: Muscle-powered strap-on wings used in a low-gravity environment with an atmosphere. Learn Flight (p. 195) for endurance flying. Default: Glider-4.\nLow-Performance Spacecraft: Any space vehicle that accelerates at less than 0.1G. Defaults: Aerospace-4 or High-Performance Spacecraft-2.\nUltralight: Any winged aircraft weighing 0.5 tons or less and flying at 200 mph or slower. Defaults: Glider or Light Airplane at -2, other Airplane specialties at -4, or other Piloting at -5.\nVertol: Any aircraft that flies by brute-force application of thrust rather than by using rotors or wings. Defaults: Contragravity-3, Helicopter-4, or other Piloting at -5.",
  "skill-description-enthrallment": "Bards in fantasy can often influence others through storytelling. The GM may choose to represent this ability using the four Enthrallment skills described below. Depending on the setting, these skills might be magical, psionic, or a cinematic form of hypnotism. Each has a time requirement, FP cost, and duration, and requires two skill rolls to use.\nAt the outset of the tale, roll vs. Public Speaking skill; if you can’t grab your audience’s attention early on, you won’t have much of a chance of controlling them by the end. On a success, proceed to the Enthrallment skill roll; critical success gives +1 on that roll. On a failure, you may still attempt the Enthrallment roll, but at a penalty equal to your margin of failure. Critical failure means your Enthrallment attempt fails automatically.\nAfter the time required to enthrall has passed, roll a Quick Contest ofyour Enthrallment skill vs. the Will of each audience member. If you win, you affect your audience – see the individual skill description for effects. If you lose or tie, there is no effect. However, if you critically fail, your audience instantly turns hostile!\nYou may never learn these skills at a skill level higher than your Public Speaking skill.\nAudience Size: An 'audience' can be one listener or a hundred – as many as can hear the tale. However, the number of audience members that you can enthrall at one sitting is limited to your Charisma level squared, to a maximum of 25 people at Charisma 5.",
  "skill-description-liquid-projector": "This is the ability to use a weapon that projects a stream of liquid or gas. Roll against Liquid Projector skill to hit your target.\nMake an IQ-based Liquid Projector roll to take immediate action (e.g., patch a leak), should your weapon fail.\nYou must specialize by weapon type:\nFlamethrower: Any weapon that projects burning liquid or gas. (This does not include plasma weapons, which are often called 'flamers'; use Beam Weapons skill for those.)\nSprayer: Any weapon that emits a gas or atomized liquid (nerve gas, sleeping gas, etc.), including an ordinary spray can used as an improvised weapon.\nSquirt Gun: Any weapon that fires a low-pressure stream of liquid at the rate of one squirt per pull of the trigger.\nWater Cannon: Any weapon that fires a continuous jet of high-pressure liquid, usually but not always water, with the intent of causing knockback.\nThese specialties default to one another at -4. The weapons covered by each specialty vary by TL; e.g., Liquid Projector (Flamethrower) covers fire-siphons loaded with Greek fire at TL4, while at TL6, it covers backpack tanks that project thickened fuel.",
  "skill-description-professional-skill": "Many realistic job skills are more useful for making a living than for adventuring. Most such skills do not appear in this skill list – but you can still learn them if you want! Each is a separate Professional Skill. If your 'adventuring' skills aren’t useful for earning money, a Professional Skill can help you earn a steady income. To qualify for most jobs, you will need the relevant Professional Skill at 12+ (unless you are supposed to be incompetent!).\nMost professions encompass a body of knowledge. The associated Professional Skills are IQ/Average and default to IQ-5, because the smarter you are, the better you can recall and employ the techniques used at your job. Examples include air traffic controller, barber, brewer, cooper, distiller, dyer, florist, game designer, journalist, prostitute, tanner, vintner, and zookeeper.\nA few professions – glassblower, tailor, weaver, etc. – focus more on precision than on recall. These Professional Skills are DX/Average and default to DX-5.At the GM’s option, a given Professional Skill might also default to other skills. For instance, 'Journalist' would logically default to Writing-3.\nThe skills associated with highly paid or respected professions often have prerequisites. For instance, 'Air Traffic Controller' might require Electronics Operation (Sensors) skill. Like defaults, prerequisites are up to the GM.\nYou are free to create your own Professional Skills, subject to GM approval. They should be unique and well defined, not just a compilation of existing skills.",
  "skill-description-teamster": "This is the skill of driving a team of animals pulling a wagon, chariot, etc. It includes the ability to harness and care for the beasts, and judge them for quality before purchase. If the animals are ornery or badly trained (GM’s judgment), you must make a successful Animal Handling roll before you can attempt a Teamster roll.\nFor normal travel, make a Teamster roll once per day. When moving at a gallop (80% or more of the animals’ full Move) or when executing complex maneuvers with a chariot in combat, roll every 10 seconds.\nA failure usually means nothing worse than lost time or a wider turn than intended. A critical failure – or any failure at a gallop – spills the wagon or chariot. Treat this as a five-yard fall for each passenger and animal involved (see Falling, p. 431). As well, roll 2d for each beast; on a 12, a leg is broken! You will have to make Animal Handling rolls to calm the beasts. Time required to reload the cargo depends on the load, terrain, and weather.\nYou must specialize by animal type; the most common specialty is Teamster (Equines), which covers horses and mules. Teamster specialties default to one another at -3.",
  "skill-modifiers-teamster": "-2 for more than four animals; -2 for a team of unfamiliar animals; up to -5 for bad terrain.",
  "skill-description-bioengineering": "This is the ability to engineer living organisms with specific characteristics, or to create biotechnological products. You must specialize:\nCloning: The creation and growth of clones.\nGenetic Engineering: The manipulation and modification of genes.\nTissue Engineering: The manufacture of organs and tissues.\nThese specialties default to each other at -4.",
  "skill-description-innate-attack": "This skill represents trained ability with a 'built-in' ranged attack: fiery breath, super-powered energy bolts, etc. Learn it to improve your odds of hitting with Afflictions (p. 35), Bindings (p. 40), Innate Attacks (p. 61), magical jets and missiles, and similar attacks that originate from you as opposed to a weapon in your hand. Roll against skill to hit.\nYou must specialize:\nBeam: Any energy blast, magical jet, etc. emitted from the hands. To use this skill, you must have at least one unrestrained hand (although it need not be empty).\nBreath: Any attack emitted from the mouth, such as dragon’s fire or acidic sputum. To use this skill, you cannot be gagged and you must be facing your target.\nGaze: Any attack emitted from the eyes – heat vision, a petrifying stare, etc. To use this skill, you cannot be blindfolded and you must be facing your target.\nProjectile: Any solid projectile or pseudo-solid energy bolt (e.g., Fireball spell) emitted from the hands. To use this skill, you must have at least one unrestrained hand (although it need not be empty).\nThese specialties default to one another at -2.\nYou use this skill to direct your attack, not to activate it; therefore, restrictions such as 'you cannot be gagged' apply strictly to your ability to make ranged attacks. If you can trigger your attack while restrained, no skill roll is needed to attack your restraints!\nYou can only learn this skill for ranged attacks. Use Brawling (p. 182) to improve your odds with abilities that require a touch.",
  "skill-description-physiology": "This is the study of the human body and its function. A physiologist knows how bones, muscles, and organs work, and where they are located. In settings with multiple sapient species, you must specialize by race. Defaults between species (if any) are up to the GM.",
  "skill-description-explosives": "This is the skill of working with explosives and incendiaries.\nYou must specialize:\nDemolition: The ability to prepare and set explosives in order to blow things up. Make a roll whenever you use explosives in this way. A failure indicates an error. The gravity of the error depends on the amount by which you failed; a badly failed roll in close quarters can blow you up! Time required varies – it takes only a couple of seconds to set a prepared charge, but it might take hours to demolish a large bridge or a sky-scraper. When setting an explosive trap, use this skill rather than Traps. Rolls to set a 'trap' fuse (e.g., a land mine) instead of a timed fuse are at -2. Defaults: Engineer (Combat) or (Mining) at -3.\nExplosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD): The ability to disarm and dispose of bombs and other explosives. When disarming a trap, roll a Quick Contest of your Explosives (EOD) skill vs. the Explosives (Demolition) skill of the person who created the device. A failure (or even a critical failure) does not necessarily mean an explosion – the GM can be much more creative than that! Sudden hissing noises, mysterious parts falling off, cramps, itches, and alarm bells are all possible in the right circumstances. It is best if the GM rolls the dice and describes the physical circumstances to the victim. Fright Checks are appropriate for the survivors of a failed EOD attempt! Prerequisite: DX 12+.\nFireworks: The skill of making pyrotechnic devices – fireworks, flares, smoke bombs, flash grenades, etc. Most of these things can be used by anyone. Default: Chemistry-3.\nNuclear Ordnance Disposal (NOD): The equivalent of Explosives (EOD) for nuclear devices. Disarming a military nuclear weapon is straight-forward; disarming a homemade terrorist bomb might be more difficult. Only a critical failure verified by a second critical failure will result in a nuclear detonation. Any lesser failure will – at worst – detonate the high-explosive trigger and contaminate the immediate area with radioactive material ... not that this is a great deal of consolation to those nearby.\nUnderwater Demolition (UD): The ability to prepare and set explosives underwater. This is otherwise identical to Explosives (Demolition).\nYou usually need Scuba skill – or at least Swimming skill – to get into a position where you can use this skill.\nThese specialties default to one another at -4 except for Demolition and UD, which default to one another at -2, and EOD and NOD, which also default to one another at -2.",
  "skill-description-expert-skill": "An Expert Skill represents cross-disciplinary knowledge of a single, narrow theme. When answering factual questions on that theme, you may substitute a roll against your Expert Skill for any IQ-based roll against any skill that has a default. Expert Skills do not exempt you from Cultural Familiarity (p. 23) or Language (p. 23) requirements, and never provide the ability to do practical tasks. Experts sometimes complement Expert Skills with related Area Knowledge skills (p. 176), but you must learn these separately.\nYou must specialize by theme, and the GM is free to forbid any theme he feels is too broad. Some examples:\nComputer Security: Expertise at combating computer intrusion ('hacking'). Can stand in for Computer Operation, Cryptography, or Electronics Operation to spot 'holes' in the security of a computer system. Use Computer Programming to patch or exploit such holes.\nConspiracy Theory: The study of interlocking networks of conspiracies. Can substitute for Anthropology, Geography, History, Literature, or Occultism to answer questions about conspiracies, and can also work as Intelligence Analysis for this purpose (only). This does not include hidden inner secrets, which are the province of Hidden Lore (p. 199).\nEgyptology: The study of ancient Egypt. Can function as Anthropology, Archaeology, History, Linguistics, or Occultism for that purpose.\nEpidemiology: The study of the spread of disease. Can serve as Biology, Diagnosis, Forensics, Geography, or Mathematics when deducing how a disease was spread.\nHydrology: The study of a planet’s water. Can be used in place of Biology, Chemistry, Geography, Geology, or Meteorology to answer questions about precipitation, flooding, irrigation, etc.\nMilitary Science: General expertise on military capabilities. Can substitute for Artillery, Armoury, Strategy, or Tactics to answer questions about – but not use – weapons or strategies.\nNatural Philosophy: A general skill that usually replaces specific science skills (which might not even exist yet!) for scholars at TL1-4. Can be used in place of any science skill (e.g., Biology or Physics) to answer questions about how the universe is believed to work.\nPolitical Science: The academic study of politics. Can substitute for Geography, History, Law, Politics, or Sociology when performing political analysis.\nPsionics: The study of the psionic mind and brain. Can function as Biology, Diagnosis, Physician, Physiology, or Psychology when dealing with psi phenomena in living beings. Cannot substitute for Electronics Operation, Electronics Repair, and Engineer specialties that deal with psychotronics.\nThanatology: The esoteric study of death. Can stand in for Anthropology, Archaeology, Occultism, or Theology when dealing with death and the dead.\nXenology: General knowledge of the known races in your setting. Can substitute for Anthropology, History, Physiology, or Psychology to identify a member of a race different from your own, or to answer general questions about the race and its culture.",
  "skill-description-engineer": "This is the ability to design and build technological devices and systems. A successful roll lets you design a new system, diagnose a glitch, identify the purpose of a strange device, or improvise a gadget to solve a problem. Time required for each attempt is up to the GM.\nNote that engineers are designers and inventors; they are not necessarily skilled at the routine operation or maintenance of the things they design! For instance, Engineer (Small Arms) lets you design a new assault rifle, but you need Armoury skill to maintain it and Guns skill to shoot it.\nYou must specialize. Possible fields include:\nArtillery: Designing whatever passes for artillery at your TL, from trebuchets to smart missiles. Default: Armoury (Heavy Weapons)-6.\nCivil: Planning highways, aqueducts, buildings, etc. Default: Architecture-6.\nClockwork: Designing wind-up gadgetry – watches, mechanical men, and the like.

Default: Mechanic (Nanomachines)-6.\nParachronic: Designing apparatus for crossing dimensions or timelines. Prerequisite: Physics. Default: Electronics Operation (Parachronic)-6, but there is no default if your society has not discovered dimensional travel.\nPsychotronics: Designing psionic technology, such as telepathic shields and amplifiers. Default: Electronics Operation (Psychotronics)-6, but there is no default for individuals from backgrounds where psionics do not exist.\nRobotics: Designing robotics and cybernetics. Default: Mechanic (Robotics)-6.\nSmall Arms: Designing personal firearms, such as guns and portable rocket launchers. Default: Armoury (Small Arms)-6.\nTemporal: Designing time machines. Prerequisite: Physics. Default: Electronics Operation (Temporal)-6, but there is no default for individuals from backgrounds without time travel!\nVehicle Type: Designing a single, broad class of vehicle. Examples include Engineer (Automobiles), Engineer (Ships), and Engineer (Starships). Default: Mechanic (same vehicle type)-6.\nEngineer specialties normally default to one another at -4; however, the GM is free to rule that in his campaign, there is no default between exotic specialties (Nanotechnology, Parachronic, Psychotronics, etc.) and more mundane ones (Civil, Combat, Mining, etc.).",
  "skill-description-electronics-operation": "This skill lets you use all electronic equipment within a known specialty.\nMake a skill roll in an emergency situation or for 'abnormal' use of equipment – not for ordinary, everyday use. (Exception: Unskilled users must always attempt their default roll!)\nYou must specialize. Available specialties vary by game world, but might include:\nCommunications (Comm): All forms of electronic communications technology: radios, satellite uplinks, laser communicators, etc. Includes knowledge of any standard, current communications codes appropriate to your background. These do not require a skill roll – although attempts to understand or use an unfamiliar code do require a roll. At TL5-7, this includes telegraphy: you can send or receive 2 words per minute (wpm) per point of skill at TL5, 3 wpm per point of skill at TL6-7.\nElectronic Warfare (EW): All signals-intelligence and jamming equipment, including electronic counter-measures (ECM) and electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM). In most game worlds, only intelligence agencies and the military teach this specialty – and only to individuals with suitable Military Rank (p. 30) or Security Clearance (p. 82).\nForce Shields: Portable, vehicular, base, and starship force shields and deflectors.\nMatter Transmitters (MT): All matter transmitters and teleporters. Critical failures can be disastrous, especially when transmitting living beings!\nMedia: All forms of audio, film, and video editing equipment. If three-dimensional video ('holographics') or sensory recordings ('sensies') exist in the setting, this specialty includes the ability to operate the relevant equipment. Treat different media as mutually unfamiliar technologies.\nMedical: All manner of electronic diagnostic and life-support equipment.\nParachronic: Technological means of travel between dimensions or timelines.\nPsychotronics: Psionic technology, such as telepathic shields and amplifiers.\nScientific: Laboratory electronics and survey gear. You are automatically familiar with the equipment used with any scientific skill on which you have spent at least one point.\nSecurity: Both operating and circumventing all forms of alarms, security sensors, and area-surveillance technology.\nSensors: Most forms of long-range detection gear, from air-defense radar to starship sensor suites. Certain highly specialized sensors (such as sonar, below) have their own specialties.\nSonar: All types of acoustic detection and ranging gear (normally used underwater).\nSurveillance: All forms of concealable or remote surveillance gear: 'bugs,' hidden cameras, long-range microphones, wiretaps, etc.\nTemporal: All manner of time machines. Critical failures can be disastrous for the time travelers! Make separate rolls to 'lock onto' and transfer the travelers.\nThese specialties default to one another at -4; however, the GM is free to rule that in his campaign, there is no default between exotic specialties (Parachronic, Psychotronics, etc.) and mundane ones (Media, Security, etc.). The technologies covered by a particular specialty vary with TL. For instance, Electronics Operation (Comm) covers telegraphs at TL5, telephones and radios at TL6, and digital communications systems at TL8 ... and might cover faster-than-light or telepathic communicators at higher TLs.\nFamiliarity (p. 169) is crucial here! Electronics Operation/TL8 (Sensors) covers both thermographs on fighter jets and ground-penetrating radars on satellites, but going from one to the other gives you -2 for type (thermo-graph to radar) and -2 for implementation (jet to satellite), for a net -4 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences.",
  "skill-description-philosophy": "This is the study of a system of principles to live by. You must specialize in a particular school of philosophy; e.g., Confucianism, Marxism, or Stoicism.

On a success, the GM will 'enlighten' you and provide a hint as to which course of action 'feels' right given your beliefs.",
  "skill-description-anthropology": "This is the science of evolution and culture. An anthropologist is knowledgeable in the ways of primitive (and not-so-primitive) societies. An Anthropology roll might explain, or even predict, unusual rituals and folk customs. This skill requires specialization by species (if left unspecified, assume the anthropologist’s own species). Specialties usually default to one another at -2 to -5, although there may be no default for completely alien species.",
  "skill-description-mimicry": "This is the ability to imitate voices. The Voice advantage (p. 97) gives +2 to skill. You must specialize:\nAnimal Sounds: Lets you emulate a lion’s roar, a wolf’s howl, a frog’s croak, etc. You can only imitate animals that have distinctive sounds. Make a skill roll to attract animals of the type mimicked – or predators that normally hunt those animals – if any are nearby. To fool people, you must win a Quick Contest of Mimicry vs. the listeners’ Naturalist-3 or Perception-6. Default: Naturalist-6.\nBird Calls: Allows you to reproduce the whistles, chirps, and other sounds made by birds. Otherwise, this works as Animal Sounds. Default: Naturalist-6.\nSpeech: Enables you to imitate vocal sounds. This does not allow you to converse in a foreign language, but if you have heard it, you can reproduce the sound of it. If you are trying to mimic a specific person, roll at -3. Treat this roll as a Quick Contest vs. the IQ of anyone who knows the person mimicked well. Defaults: Acting-6 or Linguistics-4.\nAnimal Sounds and Bird Calls default to one another at -6. There is no default between these specialties and Speech.\nNote that if you have the Mimicry advantage (p. 68), there is no need to learn this skill!",
  "skill-description-pharmacy": "This is the skill of preparing medicines to treat illness. (To work with noxious drugs, use Poisons skill, p. 214.) You must specialize:\nHerbal: The ability to make and administer remedies prepared from plants. Make a Naturalist roll to locate herbs. Before TL5, this is the only specialty available. It replaces Physician (below) and is frequently used in conjunction with Esoteric Medicine (p. 192). At TL5+, this specialty remains available, but Pharmacy (Synthetic) is much more common. Prerequisite: Naturalist. Defaults: Biology-5, Herb Lore-5, or Naturalist-5.\nSynthetic: The skill of preparing drugs under 'laboratory' conditions. To prescribe drugs, use Physician skill. This specialty is only available at TL5+. Defaults: Chemistry-5 or Physician-5.",
  "skill-description-theology": "This is the study of a particular religion: its gods, cosmology, doctrines, scriptures, etc. You must specialize by religion. There are usually no defaults between specialties, but the GM might permit a default at -4 or so for belief systems that have similar origins, or where one is derived from the other.\nAlternatively, you may study the similarities and differences between religions; this is Theology (Comparative). The Theology of any religion routinely studied by scholars in your game world defaults to this specialty at -5.\nTo be a priest or holy man at TL1+, you must have both Theology and Religious Ritual skill (p. 217) for your religion. TL0 shamans need only learn Religious Ritual.\nYou do not necessarily believe in the religion you study – faith comes from within, not from book learning! Ifyoudo,youmayasktheGMto make a secret roll against your Theology skill when confronted with moral uncertainty. On a success, the GM will advise you on which course of action 'feels' right, given your beliefs and understanding of scripture.",
  "skill-description-strategy": "This is the ability to plan military actions and predict the actions of the enemy. In most settings, only the military teaches this skill.\nA successful Strategy roll lets you deduce, in advance, enemy military plans unless another person with this skill leads them. In that case, the GM rolls a Quick Contest of Strategy. The amount of information gained depends on how well you roll (but not on the quality of the foe’s plans). If you fail an uncontested roll or lose a Quick Contest, the GM gives you false information.\nYou must specialize in a type of strategy – Land, Naval, Space, etc. These specialties default to one another at -4. The specific units being commanded are less important; even the units of another nation or tech level would give -1 or -2 at most (GM’s judgment), as long as you had accurate information about their capabilities.",
  "skill-description-guns": "This is the ability to use a handheld chemical-propellant or mass-driver projectile weapon. Roll against Guns skill to hit your target.\nMake an IQ-based skill roll to take immediate action (e.g., eject a dud round), should your weapon fail.\nYou must specialize by weapon type. The available specialties vary by TL, but include one or more of:\nGrenade Launcher (GL): Any large-bore, low-powered small arm that fires a bursting projectile. Includes under-barrel grenade launchers, flare pistols, and ultra-tech 'tanglers.'\nGyroc: Any kind of small arm that fires miniature rockets.\nLight Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW): All forms of rocket launchers and recoilless rifles.\nLight Machine Gun (LMG): Any machine gun fired from the hip or a bipod.\nMusket: Any kind of smoothbore long arm (usually, but not always, a black powder weapon) that fires a solid projectile.\nPistol: All kinds of handguns, including derringers, pepperboxes, revolvers, and automatics, but not machine pistols.\nRifle: Any kind of rifled long arm – assault rifle, hunting rifle, sniper rifle, etc. – that fires a solid projectile.\nShotgun: Any kind of smoothbore long arm that fires multiple projectiles (flechettes, shot, etc.).\nSubmachine Gun (SMG): All short, fully automatic weapons that fire pistol-caliber ammunition, including machine pistols.\nMost of these specialties default to one another at -2, but defaults involving GL, Gyroc, or LAW are at -4 in either direction. The weapons covered by each specialty vary by TL. For example, Guns (Rifle) covers muzzle-loaders at TL4, lever actions at TL5, and self-loaders at TL6+. In particular, ammunition varies with TL, from black powder and loose shot at TL4, to smokeless powder cartridges at TL6, to power cells and metallic slivers for TL9+ electromagnetic guns.\nFamiliarity is crucial here! Guns (Rifle) covers both bolt-action 12.7mm sniper rifles and 5.56mm assault rifles, but going from one to the other gives you -2 for weapon type (12.7mm to 5.56mm), -2 for action (bolt-action to self-loader), and -2 for grip (bipod to hand-held), for a total of -6 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences.",
  "skill-description-history": "This is the study of the recorded past (compare Archaeology skill, p. 176). A successful skill roll lets you answer questions about history, and might (at the GM’s option) allow you to remember a useful parallel: 'Ah, yes. Hannibal faced a situation like this once, and here’s what he did ...'\nYou must specialize. There are two general classes of specialty:\n• A limited geographical region – no larger than a small nation – over multiple eras. Examples: History (Bavarian), History (Irish), or History (New York State).\n• A single era (e.g., Victorian period, 20th century) and one of a broad geographical region (e.g., Europe), a culture (e.g., Muslim), or an idea (e.g., economic, esoteric, or military). Examples: History (20th-Century American), History (Ottoman Muslim), or History (Napoleonic Military).\nThe sheer variety of possible specialties makes it impossible to list all possible defaults. In general, if two specialties overlap at all, then GM should permit a default at -2 to -4.",
  "skill-description-navigation": "This is the ability to find your position through careful observation of your surroundings and the use of instrumentation. A successful roll tells you where you are or lets you plot a course.\nYou must specialize:\nSea: Navigation by the stars and ocean currents. Modifiers: +3 if you have Absolute Direction (p. 34), or a high-tech global positioning system or inertial compass; -5 (and no use of Astronomy default) if you lack high-tech aids, the weather is bad, and the stars are hidden. Defaults: Astronomy-5 or Seamanship-5.\nAir: Navigation by the stars and by the terrain below. Modifiers are as for Navigation (Sea). Default: Astronomy-5.\nLand: Navigation using landmarks and the stars; also called 'orienteering.' Modifiers: +3 if you have Absolute Direction or a high-tech substitute. Defaults: IQ-5, Cartography-4, or Mathematics (Surveying)-4.\nSpace: Navigating through ordinary interplanetary and interstellar space, usually at less than the speed of light (but some science-fiction 'warp drives' let you travel at faster-than-light speeds in normal space). Modifiers: +2 for 3D Spatial Sense (p. 34). Defaults: Astronomy-4 or Mathematics (Applied)-4.\nHyperspace: Also called 'astrogation.' Similar to Navigation (Space), but used when traveling through 'jump space' or 'hyperspace.' In settings with multiple faster-than-light drive technologies, there may be one Navigation specialty per drive type. Modifiers are as for Navigation (Space). Defaults: Astronomy-4 or Mathematics (Applied)-4.\nAir, Land, and Sea default to one another at -2. Space and Hyperspace default to one another at -5. There are no defaults between these two groups.",
  "skill-description-fast-draw": "This skill lets you quickly draw a weapon from its holster, sheath, or hiding place. A successful roll means you ready the weapon instantly. This does not count as a combat maneuver; you can use the weapon to attack on the same turn. On a failure, you ready your weapon normally but may do nothing else on your turn. A critical failure means you drop the weapon!\nYou must specialize in one of these weapon types: Force Sword, Knife, Long Arm (rifle, shotgun, submachine gun, etc.), Pistol, Sword (any one-handed blade larger than a knife), or Two-Handed Sword. The GM may add Fast-Draw skills for other weapons (or even tools) that one could reasonably draw quickly.\nIn addition to the above specialties, there are two Fast-Draw skills that allow you to reload missile weapons quickly:\nFast-Draw (Arrow): Lets you ready a single arrow, bolt, or dart instantly. This reduces the time required to reload a bow, crossbow, or blowgun by one second.\nFast-Draw/TL (Ammo): Reduces the time required to reload any kind of gun or beam weapon. The exact benefits depend on your weapon, but a successful roll always shaves at least one second off the reload time. This skill varies greatly with TL! At TL4, it covers powder-and-shot drills; at TL6+, it includes speed-loading techniques for detachable magazines; and at higher tech levels, it involves quickly replacing energy cells and attaching power cables.\nFor the Arrow and Ammo specialties, failure means you drop the arrow or bolt, or accidentally discard one round of ammunition. On a critical failure, you drop the entire quiver, powder horn, ammo box, magazine, etc., scattering loose ammunition everywhere!",
  "skill-description-riding": "This is the ability to ride a particular kind of mount. Make a skill roll when you first try to mount a riding animal, and again each time something happens to frighten or challenge the creature (e.g., a jump).\nYou must specialize by riding beast. Defaults between specialties vary from 0 to -10. For instance, if you have Riding (Horse), Riding (Mule) is essentially the same skill (no default penalty), Riding (Camel) would default at -3, Riding (Dolphin) at -6, and Riding (Dragon) at a whopping -10!",
  "skill-modifiers-riding": "+5 if the animal knows and likes you; +1 or more for a mount with the Mount skill (p. 210); -10 if the animal has not been trained for riding.",
  "skill-description-religious-ritual": "This is the ability to perform religious rites – masses, funerals, weddings, etc. – before a congregation. You must specialize by religion. This skill includes detailed knowledge of the ritual motions, prayers, and trappings of the faith, as well as the ability to capture and hold the attention of worshipers. For religions that practice sacrifice, Religious Ritual also covers familiarity with sacrificial tools and methods.\nTo be a priest or holy man at TL1+, you must have both Religious Ritual and Theology skill (p. 226) for your religion. TL0 shamans need only learn Religious Ritual.\nIn worlds where priests can perform miracles, each magical ritual or spell is a separate skill, but certain 'mundane' religious rituals – such as sacrifice – can give bonuses to spell rolls. You must always make a successful Religious Ritual roll to claim such a bonus. In other settings, a priest’s magic is only as good as his ritual. If this is the case, your roll to work magic is against the lower of Religious Ritual and your actual spell skill.",
  "skill-description-current-affairs": "This is the ability to assimilate quickly whatever qualifies as 'news' in your world, and to recall it as needed. You must specialize in one of the following areas:\nBusiness: Exchange rates, investment performance, etc.\nHeadline News: Usually bad news, such as assassinations, plagues, and wars.\nHigh Culture: Information on galleries, operas, symphonies, and so forth.\nPeople: The names of and gossip on celebrities, heads of state, and the like.\nPolitics: Election results, international treaties, etc.\nPopular Culture: Hit songs, cool fashions, and hot products, among other things.\nRegional: News of all kinds for a specific region (pick one). This is the definitive 'town crier' skill at low TLs.\nScience & Technology: New discoveries and inventions.\nSports: Scores for recent matches, names of star athletes, etc.\nTravel: Where the 'beautiful people' are going this year, and how much it all costs.\nThese specialties default to one another at -4. It is hard to bone up on one kind of news without learning about all the others!\nOn a successful Current Affairs roll, the GM will inform you of any news within your specialty that pertains to the current adventure (possibly including clues, on a good roll) or give you a small skill bonus (e.g., a success on Current Affairs (Sports) might give +1 to Gambling skill when betting on a boxing match).",
  "skill-description-hobby-skill": "Many fields of study have little to do with adventuring or making a living – but people study them nonetheless. Each of these is a separate Hobby Skill. Those that require agility or a delicate touch (e.g., juggling, kite flying, needlepoint, and origami) are DX/Easy skills that default to DX-4, while those that focus on knowledge and trivia (e.g., comic books, rock music, science fiction, and tropical fish) are IQ/Easy skills that default to IQ-4.\nA few points in a Hobby Skill can make roleplaying more fun – and possibly come in handy once in a while. You do not need a teacher to learn or improve a Hobby Skill. However, you cannot learn skills defined elsewhere in this chapter as Hobby Skills.",
  "skill-description-animal-handling": "This is the ability to train and work with animals. You must specialize in a category of animals – the more intelligent the animals, the narrower the category. Examples of interest to adventurers: Big Cats (jaguars, lions, tigers, etc.), Dogs, Equines (horses and donkeys), and Raptors (eagles, falcons, and hawks). The default between specialties is -2 within the same order (e.g., Dogs to Big Cats), -4 across orders (e.g., Dogs to Equines), and -6 for larger differences (e.g., Dogs to Raptors).\nTo train an animal, make an Animal Handling roll once per day of training. A failed roll means the animal learned nothing; a badly failed roll means you are attacked. The time it takes to train an animal depends on the beast’s intelligence and tractability (see Chapter 16).\nWhen working with a trained animal, roll against skill for each task you set the animal. This roll is at -5 if the animal is not familiar with you, -5 if the circumstances are stressful to the animal, and -3 or more if the task is a complex one. To put on an entertaining circus act, snake-charming show, etc., you must make a separate Performance roll!\nThis skill can also (sometimes) be used to quiet a wild, dangerous, or untrained animal. This roll is at -5 if the creature is wild or very frightened, or -10 if it is a man-eater or man-killer.\nFinally, this skill gives an advantage in combat against animals within your specialty. If you have Animal Handling at level 15, an animal’s attack and defense rolls are at -1 against you, because you can predict its behavior. At skill 20, the animal’s rolls are at -2.",
  "skill-description-mathematics": "This is the scientific study of quantities and magnitudes, and their relationships and attributes, through the use of numbers and symbols. You must specialize:\nApplied: The branch of mathematics that interacts directly with the physical sciences and engineering, dealing with mathematical models of the behavior of physical systems. Defaults: Engineer (any)-5 or Physics-5.\nComputer Science: The theoretical study of data structures and computation. Roll vs. skill to answer questions about what is possible with computers. This gives you no special ability to use computers! Default: Computer Programming-5.\nCryptology: The mathematical study of codes and ciphers. This gives you a theoretical understanding of encryption schemes, including how they change with TL and why some schemes are more effective than others. To create or break codes, use Cryptography skill (p. 186). Default: Cryptography-5.\nPure: Generic 'academic' mathematics. Make a skill roll to answer any math-related question not covered by another specialty. Pure mathematics encompasses dozens of obscure subfields that will never affect the game. If you must be an expert in something like 'non-selfadjoint operator algebras,' you may further note an optional specialty (p. 169).\nStatistics: The science of assembling and analyzing data for the purpose of calculating probabilities, constructing models, and making forecasts. Roll vs. skill to determine the odds of a particular outcome, given sufficient data about similar situations in the past.\nSurveying: The science of determining the area of a portion of the Earth’s surface, the lengths and directions of the bounding lines, and the contour of the surface. Make a skill roll to determine the dimensions of any area you can see. More complex determinations require specialized equipment. Defaults: Cartography-3 or Navigation (any)-4.\nThese specialties default to one another at -5.",
  "skill-description-meteorology": "This is the study of the weather, and the ability to predict it. It includes familiarity with technological aids such as barometers and satellite maps, but you can still function without your instruments. (If you can’t, you’re a meter-reader, not a meteorologist!)\nWhen you wish to predict the weather, the GM rolls against your skill in secret. On a success, he tells the truth; on a failure, he answers randomly, or lies. Each skill roll predicts the weather for one day. If one day’s roll fails, subsequent ones can’t succeed. For instance, a three-day forecast would require three skill rolls: the first for tomorrow, the second for the next day, and the third for the day after that.\nA successful roll also allows you to deduce what sort of general climate to expect when you visit a new area.At TL4 or less, this skill is called Weather Sense, and you get +2 to skill in your home area. At TL5 and up, Meteorology is a scientific skill, and you must specialize by planet type; see Planet Types (p. 180) for details.",
  "skill-description-paleontology": "This is the science of fossil study. Make a skill roll to recognize fossils or to deduce an organism’s habitat, structure, etc. from fossil evidence. A successful roll – with equipment modifiers (p. 345) for lab facilities – identifies the approximate age of a fossil.\nYou must specialize:\nMicropaleontology: The study of fossils too small to be seen with the naked eye. This skill requires a lab.\nPaleoanthropology: The study of human fossils and tools, and the relation of primitive tribes to their habitats. Also defaults to Anthropology-2.\nPaleobotany: The study of vegetable fossils.\nPaleozoology: The study of prehistoric animals from fossilized bones, food, feces, footprints, etc.\nThese specialties default to one another at -2.",
  "skill-description-beam-weapons": "This is the ability to use beam small arms. You must specialize by weapon type:\nPistol: Any handgun that fires an energy or particle beam.\nProjector: Any energy weapon that emits an area-effect cone or field.\nRifle: Any long arm that fires an energy or particle beam.\nThese specialties default to one another at -4. Treat specific beam types (blaster, laser, stunner, etc.) as familiarities. Other modifiers are as per Guns (p. 198). In settings with both beam and projectile weapons, the Pistol and Rifle specialties of Beam Weapons default to the similarly named Guns specialties at -4, and vice versa.\nSee Artillery (p. 178) and Gunner (p. 198) for heavier beam weapons.",
  "skill-description-hidden-lore": "This skill represents knowledge that is lost, deliberately hidden, or simply neglected. Whatever the reason, the general public is unaware of it. It is only available to those who study it specifically.\nYou must specialize in a particular body of secret knowledge. If you wish to enter play with Hidden Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills. Of course, the GM is also free to forbid Hidden Lore skills to starting characters ... or to PCs in general!\nTo acquire Hidden Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Hidden Lore to specific acts – such as reading moldy tomes – instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill.\nRemember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous.\nPossible Hidden Lore specialties include:\nConspiracies: You know details about the conspiracies that underlie every aspect of society. This is factual knowledge (e.g., truths about the Illuminati), not the ability to analyze conspiracies. Only available in settings where vast conspiracies really do exist.\nDemon Lore: You know the secrets of Hell, the goals of demons in the mortal world, and possibly even the names of specific demons.\nFaerie Lore: You have detailed knowledge of the faeries and their secret kingdom(s).\nSpirit Lore: You know about ghosts and other spirit entities – names, motivations, etc.",

When cast underwater, it makes bubbles! When cast on a one-yard-radius area, the spell creates about 45 cubic feet of air every second for five seconds; each cubic foot of air will last a single person at rest about a minute.

This effect does 1d-2 damage to anyone in the area of effect who fails a HT roll. Any beings with the Body of Air meta-trait (p. B262) take 2d damage.

Victims may not notice the spell's effect until they begin losing FP; roll vs. Per to notice the changed quality of the air. Sleeping victims must roll vs. HT to wake up once they begin suffocating. The spell lasts until living air diffuses back into the affected area. This takes 1 minute per yard of radius in an unventilated area, or as little as 10 seconds on a windy day outdoors.

High-tech bullets suffer a -2 penalty to hit for every yard of the wall of wind they pass through. Beings standing within the wall's thickness are at -3 DX and suffer 2d of knockback in a random direction every second. The wall also churns up loose ground material, such as dust, small leaves, insects, and twigs.

The caster may move up to half his normal Move inside the eye while concentrating on this spell. Anyone within a full-strength Windstorm must roll vs. ST once per second to avoid being knocked over by the wind.

Spider Silk takes triple damage from fire-based attacks. The caster may shoot as many strands as he has arms from a single casting of Spider Silk; however, the cost to cast is based on the total length of all strands created. Thus, a many-armed spider demon can throw half a dozen strands at once, but it won't be cheap. Strands of Spider Silk may also be used to build a web by anchoring successive strands between two surfaces. This web creates an area that will grapple anyone who passes through it; mechanically, this is similar to a Binding attack with the Sticky and Area Effect enhancements (p. B40).

Backpacks, carried items, etc., simply fall to the ground. The caster retains his intelligence, but gains all the physical attributes of the new form. This means that the wearer cannot cast spells unless he knows them so well that they can be performed without gestures! Note that Fatigue Points are not increased for spellcasting purposes. Each hour that the spell continues, the caster must make a roll against IQ; failure means that the caster loses a point of IQ, continuing until the normal IQ of that beast is reached.

For most natural beast forms, an energy cost of 6 to cast and 2 to maintain is appropriate; animals with great strength, for example, tend to be counterbalanced by reduced agility. If the GM allows supernatural creatures as beast forms, however, or if he is concerned about the power of a given animal form, he may wish to change the cost of the spell.

Tiger Paws (4 to cast): The subject's hands become tiger paws, granting him Sharp Claws and Striking ST 24, but he also gains No Fine Manipulators (p. B145). Toad Tongue (3 to cast): The subject's tongue becomes long and adhesive, serving as an Extra Arm with the Long and Weak enhancements and additional Striking ST – it attacks with the subject's full strength, but lifts with only 1/4 of the subject's ST.

Thus, viewers of an Attractive subject resist with Per+1, but viewers of an Unattractive subject also resist with Per+1. The spell's effects are limited in magnitude; the subject could slip unnoticed through a crowd, but would be stopped by guards if trying to go where he should not. He can get someone's attention by grabbing him, but is then likely to get a negative reaction. If he steals something or commits some other objectionable act (removing his clothing, perhaps), all witnesses get a new resistance roll. If he attacks someone, that person is automatically released from the spell – furthermore, the victim's cries for help won't be ignored! Insignificance and Presence resist each other.  does not get to resist! The spell does not guarantee a good reaction from those it affects – it doubles the positive or negative modifier!

Once the spell is cast, the area to be transported vanishes (see below), replaced by bare earth or open water. The caster is now 'carrying' that area in invisible, intangible form (this fact can be determined by Detect Magic or something similar). Beings caught in the affected area have a resistance roll based on the best Will among them, modified by -1 for every additional yard of radius of the subject area (thus, Move Terrain with a 2-yard radius is resisted by Will-1). Successful resistance negates the spell. Once the casting is successfully completed, the subject area 'shrinks' in radius at the rate of 1 yard per second, moving toward the caster at the same rate. Victims quick enough on their feet should be able to jump out of the area as it shrinks (this has good dramatic potential) – make DX and IQ rolls! GMs may decide this warrants a Fright Check. Beings caught by the spell are aware of a wild, swirling sky above their heads and a physically impenetrable barrier all around them. The atmosphere inside remains breathable and comfortable (so this spell cannot be used to suffocate someone!). Spells cast out of the area automatically hit the Move Terrain's holder – thus, a trapped mage could walk up to the affected area's edge, lay his hand against the barrier, and cast Deathtouch at the holder! Captive mages could also cast Dispel Magic or Counterspell on the affected area, forcing the spell to end abruptly if they are successful. When the caster stops maintaining the spell, the terrain reappears. The caster's location falls anywhere within it or at its edge. The subject area 'expands' back to normal size at the same rate it shrank. If there is no suitable space available, anything in the way is moved aside as if by Shape Earth. The caster may not use this spell again for one full day. The subject area or any part of it cannot be moved again by this spell (from any caster or magic item) for the same period.

An item with only a single use can be created for 15% of the normal energy, two uses would cost 30%, four would cost 60% (very costineffective under most circumstances) and the cost for an item limited to 7 or more uses actually exceeds the cost of a permanent item. The temporarily enchanted item acts, in all respects, as a normal item of that type until all of its uses are consumed. Once all the uses of the temporary item are gone, the item is no longer magical. The Temporary Enchantment spell is used in place of the Enchant spell. A single item may not be enchanted with both temporary and permanent spells simultaneously. Temporary Enchantment can only be used to give items a one-time ability to cast a certain spell – not to cast the spell on the object. For example, a mage couldn't make a one-shot set of invisible armor – it would never wear off. He could give the armor the ability to cast the Invisibility spell on itself at normal energy and duration costs. Temporary Enchantment cannot be used in conjunction with any Enchantment college or Meta-Spell college spells except the following: Hex, Limit, Link, Name, Power, and Speed.

A golem follows verbal orders from its maker; the maker may instruct it to obey others.  Clay Golem Clay is the default material for golems; it is easily molded, both physically and supernaturally. Golem enchanters often go on to work with more difficult materials – stone, plastic, flesh – but if a golem is needed in a hurry, most enchanters return to clay.

It takes no initiative, and ignores any situation for which it has been given no orders. However, it never forgets anything it sees or is told. Golems do not heal on their own, and are destroyed if reduced to -HP. They may be repaired with Healing spells (except Resurrection) if cast by the golem's creator. There is no other way to repair a golem. To create a golem, the creator must make its body – doing all the work himself – then animate it with this spell. Once animated, a golem lasts until reduced to 0 HP or until its creator commands it to cease functioning. No concentration or maintenance is required to control a golem. A basic clay golem (see box) costs 250 energy to enchant. A more powerful golem costs an additional 2 energy for every extra character point of abilities added to the golem. In most cases, additional abilities should be restricted to extra ST, HP, and DR (a rule of thumb: 20 points of energy buys 1 ST, 5 HP, or 2 DR); however, GMs may allow more sweeping changes to the basic golem if they feel comfortable doing so. More powerful golems may require more durable (and more costly) materials, adding to the cost and time required to create the golem's body.

If removed, handled briefly, and replaced, the object will acquire a very faint impression of the handler, but it won't be enough for a Seeker spell unless the handler does so once a day for decades. It is possible for an object in a blocker container still to be useful; for example, a book open to an important page, and stored in a glass container, can still be read! At sufficiently advanced tech levels, a 'waldo' or remote-manipulation box can be enchanted, allowing handling of the object without opening the box. In some settings, these containers can also be used to preserve evidence. If an object is owned for one person for a long time, and then transferred to a new owner, the original owner's impressions may wear off.

He must fashion a doll (usually out of wax, but clay, straw, and other materials may be appropriate with the GM's permission) with something personally relevant to the target imbedded in it. Parts of the body (nail clippings, hair, blood, spittle, etc.) allow a casting at base skill. Other items allow a casting at a varying penalty; for example, threads from a shirt worn for years might be worth -2, while dirt from a fresh footprint might be worth -6. Malefice is a lasting spell (p. 10) that continues until its Endurance is reduced to 0. It starts with an Endurance equal to its caster's effective skill. The doll can be used by its maker (and no one else) to cast harmful spells (such as Pain) on the target, at normal energy cost, while ignoring distance penalties. The caster uses the lower of the Malefice's Endurance and his skill with the channeled spell. The target resists all such attacks, even if the spell is normally not Resisted (spells without normal resistance rules are Resisted by HT when cast through a Malefice doll). If the victim resists the very first spell cast upon him through the doll, the enchantment is immediately broken. Otherwise, every successful resistance simply weakens the Malefice, reducing its Endurance by 1. Upon reaching Endurance 0, the Malefice dissipates (though the doll is still a viable item for re-enchantment, and its magical association with the target offsets one point of casting penalty). A critical failure by the channeled spell or a critical success by the subject also breaks the enchantment, reducing the doll's Endurance to zero. Destroying the doll breaks the spell, but it also inflicts on the target a Deathtouch (p. 41) of as many dice as the Malefice's current Endurance divided by 5 (round down, maximum of 3d). This damage occurs as long as the Malefice has any Endurance remaining. Remove Curse frees the target from the Malefice without harm to him.",

The process requires something that is personally relevant to the subject; use the modifiers listed under Malefice. The caster's spell roll is determined by the lower of his skills with this spell and the specific spell being placed on the subject. If the caster has assistants, their skills with both spells must be 15 or greater, but the roll is based on the caster's skill. Possible ensorcelments include quite a few Body or Mind Control spells and others such as Shapeshift Other, Flesh to Stone, the various 'Body of' spells, Walk on Air, the various 'Resist' spells, Hide, Invisibility, the various 'Vision' spells and Plant Form Other. In all cases, it must be a maintainable Regular spell. When the spell is cast, the subject gets a resistance roll if the object spell allows one; distance is not a factor. Remove Curse is effective against any ensorcelment. The cost of the enchantment can be reduced if the caster includes an 'escape clause' – a particular action or condition that will break the spell. Examples include speaking a magic word, being kissed as a gesture of true love, abstaining from speech for three years, and so on. The value of the energy reduction depends on just how difficult the condition will be to meet – and the 'escape clause' must be at least possible to be worth any reduction.

The spell's energy is included in the enchantment; none is required of the user, who also may not opt to supply any power to maintain the spell. Likewise, he may not cancel the spell once cast, although the creator of the stone may specify a shorter duration than ordinary and may also invest extra energy into the enchantment so that the spell will maintain itself. A person may use only one spell stone per second. A spell stone must be made from a jewel worth $10xP2 + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the spell that may be contained. Any spell except a Blocking or Enchantment spell may be stored in a spell stone. Limiting Enchantments may be put on the stone. If the spell stored in the stone requires that the caster know another spell (Counterspell, for instance), that other spell must be specified at creation time. It is thus possible to create a spell stone that will counter one specific spell, but it is impossible to create a generic Counterspell spell stone. It is also possible to create spell stones which, when crushed, do not cast the spell for the user, but on him!

The weapon can also be left with orders to attack anyone who approaches within a certain distance; a Link can be used to activate it only if a certain event takes place. Once activated, if its owner is not around, it attacks anyone in range – closest first, unless the Link had other instructions.

The enchantment is at -1 for each full day that elapsed between the donor's death and the beginning of the enchantment. Most of the body must be present at the beginning of the enchantment, but may disposed of after it commences. The enchanter can pass on as little or as much of the donor's IQ as he wishes to the weapon, as well as some of the donor's skills, advantages, and disadvantages. The weapon has no memory of its former existence. Although it has no sensory organs, it possesses sight and hearing (Per 10). Quirks (or disadvantages reduced to quirk level) are sometimes transferred from the donor to the weapon, whether the enchanter wants them or not (this is why dogs are popular; their personalities tend to make biddable but effective weapons). The weapon can communicate with its wielder through an extremely basic empathy. When the wielder takes a course of action the weapon approves of, he gets a 'good feeling,' and if he takes one the weapon disapproves of, he gets an equivalent 'bad feeling.' The weapon may be enchanted with the Voices spell to give it a voice. Various Communication and Empathy enchantments may be added to the weapon to enhance the communication. Each time it gets a new wielder, the weapon must make a single reaction roll, which sets the tone for its relationship with the wielder from that point on. On a very good reaction, the weapon will do literally anything for its wielder; on a very bad one, it refuses to communicate or cooperate in any way. The GM should record the result; the weapon cannot be forced to roll a new reaction by being passed back and forth between wielders!",

  "spell-spell-arrow-description": "Similar to a Spell Stone, a spell arrow stores a spell until it is fired. The archer need not be a mage. The arrow's user must concentrate for the appropriate time to cast to 'arm' the spell. This cannot be simultaneous with aiming the bow, and isn't reduced by high skill (but see Speed Skill Arrow, below). An unused spell arrow disarms after 1 minute. The spell activates when the arrow hits a solid object; roll against the effective skill of the arrow's enchanter. If the roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it is a normal failure, the spell is simply wasted. Critical failures go to the Critical Spell Failure Table (p. 7). If the arrow is fired without the required concentration, the spell is wasted, but the arrow still does normal damage. The spell's energy is included in the enchantment. The archer need not (and cannot) provide any to cast the spell or maintain it. Similarly, the archer may not cancel the spell once cast, though the enchanter may specify a shorter duration than normal, and may also invest extra energy so the spell will maintain itself. The head of a spell arrow must contain a jewel worth $10xP2 + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the contained spell. The gem is destroyed when the spell activates. (The rest of the arrow may be recoverable, but is now nonmagical.) Any spell that can be enchanted into a magic item can be placed in a spell arrow, except for Blocking spells, Enchantment spells, Melee spells, or spells whose magic item description specifies 'must touch.' Note that some permissible spells are pointless (e.g., Beast-Soother), since the archer must hit the target with an arrow anyway. Enchantments may be placed on the arrow itself normally, including limiting enchantments. The only decision the archer can make is what he's aiming at. If the spell requires a subject, whatever the arrow hits is the subject. (If it is not a legal subject – e.g., a wooden wall for Strike Blind – the spell is wasted.) What constitutes a 'solid object' may require the GM's judgment (for example, drops of rain are not enough to trigger the spell). If it is an Area spell, the point of impact is the center of the area. If it is a Missile spell, the effect is as if the missile hit the target, in addition to the arrow (the missile does not launch itself from the point of impact). If the spell creates an object, the object appears as close as possible to the point of impact. If the spell would normally affect both a subject and the caster (e.g., (Animal) Control) the archer is treated as the caster. If the spell requires a human target, the spell still works even if the arrow hits clothing instead of skin. The enchanter specifies everything else: duration, area, precise effect, etc. Analyze Magic can reveal what spell a spell arrow contains, how much energy was invested, and so on (one question per casting).

Blank spell arrows have a capacity, representing the energy cost of the largest spell they can hold. When a spellcaster wishes to use the arrow, he casts the spell normally, but directs it into the arrow. If the spell is too big for the arrow, it is wasted. After the arrow has been filled, it must be used within one day (by the spellcaster or someone else), or the spell dissipates harmlessly, making the arrow blank again. All other rules for spell arrows also apply to blank spell arrows, with one exception. If the caster of the spell is also the archer, he can determine its effect at firing time, and maintain it normally.

The shield can Block two different attacks per turn, regardless of its owner's actions (so the owner could parry any blow that got by the shield, for instance). The shield can be instructed to bash (p. B406), in which case its owner forfeits the shield's protection until the beginning of his next turn (the shield will travel no more than two yards from the owner to bash). The shield can be attacked at a penalty of its DB-4. The shield's defense will be either a Block (using Shield/2) or a Dodge (using Speed); it does not get any DB bonus from itself. The shield could also be netted or bagged (standard to-hit roll). If the shield gets a critical miss or is struck by a critical hit, it is stunned and out of the fight until its owner grasps it and 'wakes it up' (a Ready maneuver).

  "spell-powerstone-type": "Enchantment",
  "spell-powerstone-description": "Infuses mana into an object for later use by a wizard. Traditionally, a gemstone serves as the subject of this spell (for this reason, 'Powerstone' is the generic word for an object containing stored mana), but any object can potentially be used. Any wizard touching a Powerstone may take any or all of the energy it contains, using it instead of his body's own energy to cast a spell. Each Powerstone is said to have a 'capacity.' This is the maximum amount of energy it can hold. Since a wizard can only use one Powerstone at a time, a large Powerstone is more useful than a handful of small ones. A large Powerstone can be used to cast a large spell; a group of small ones can be used one at a time to help maintain a spell, but cannot be used all at once. A Powerstone 'recharges' itself after use, by absorbing mana from the surrounding area. The rate of recharge varies with the area's mana level.  Local Mana None Low Normal High Very High  Recharge Rate None 1 point/week 1 point/day 1 point/12 hours 1 point/6 hours  A Powerstone does not recharge if it is within six feet of a larger Powerstone. Stones of the same size split the available mana and recharge at slower speed. This unfortunate fact means that the owner of several Powerstones must let some of them out of his sight to get them recharged! A Powerstone is enchanted one step at a time. The first time Powerstone is cast on an object, it becomes an uncharged Powerstone with capacity 1. Each additional casting increases its capacity by 1. Thus, 15 castings would create a Powerstone with a capacity of 15. But note that with this many castings, there would be a cumulative chance of nearly 1 in 4 that a critical failure would be rolled at some point, destroying the stone. For 60 successive castings, the cumulative chance of critical failure is 2 in 3! Further, each ordinary failure while casting puts some sort of magical 'quirk' on the stone. Thus, it is possible for work for months and end up with a 20-energy Powerstone that smells like fish and can only be used on Wednesdays ... This makes big stones without serious flaws more valuable than others of the same strength. The quirks of a Powerstone are set by the GM, and can be used as a tool for campaign balance. Most of them will be peculiar, arbitrary limitations on how the stone can recharge (e.g., only while bathed in bat blood) or how it can be used (e.g., only on Fire spells; only by a green-eyed virgin; not by anyone wearing a hat). A severe quirk affects the user of the stone (e.g., renders him mute for an hour). The caster knows if his spell has failed, but not what quirk his Powerstone now has. The Analyze Magic spell can determine what quirks a Powerstone has. Two failures in a row indicate that no further growth is possible for that stone. Any object may be used to produce a Powerstone. However, it is easier to enchant a Powerstone using an item with intrinsic value. The cost to cast Powerstone is quadrupled if the item being enchanted has a value of less than $10*P + $40*P, where P is the target capacity of the Powerstone. This is one reason gemstones are popular; a valuable stone is compact and durable.  A Powerstone is uncharged when created (though if it already contained energy, that energy is unaffected by a casting to increase its capacity). The energy from a Powerstone cannot be used for further enchantments on that stone – a Powerstone cannot be used to help enchant itself! Energy cost for each casting: 20.",

He may then observe and communicate with anyone in the homunculus' presence. Although the caster can cast spells from the homunculus (using his own energy), he cannot perform any physical action, since the homunculus is trapped inside the bottle. The caster may return to his original body at will. If a hostile wizard gains possession of a live homunculus, he can cast Communication and Empathy spells at the homunculus' creator at no range penalty! The creator also resists any such spells at -5 when cast through the homunculus. A homunculus is thus a great vulnerability and is only entrusted to the most faithful of servants.

Every time a spell attacks the effigy's maker, the effigy resists with its current Endurance, modified for the distance separating it from him (use the long-distance modifiers, p. 14). If the effigy succeeds, the spell affects it rather than its maker, The GM must decide what constitutes a 'hostile' spell; for instance, Deathtouch is, but Mind-Reading isn't. Redirected spells that have no effect on inanimate statues (such as Paralyze Limb or Death Vision) instead 'attack' the enchantment. The effigy then resists with its current Endurance. Every such successful attack reduces the effigy's Endurance by one; when the effigy's Endurance drops below 0, it ceases functioning.

The more 'distant' the target time is, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty (see Time modifiers, box). Unlike Teleport, there is no penalty to timeport to an 'unfamiliar' time; the GM may, however, decree that any timeport to the future bears an extra penalty (-2, perhaps). If this spell takes the caster to the future, it is the most likely of many possible futures. If he returns from that future and acts on the information gained, there is no guarantee that the future he visited will actually occur. Similarly, a caster who returns to the past, changes something, and then returns to his starting time might return to an alternate timeline. The amount of variation between the caster's 'home' timeline and the new one will depend on the GMs view of how 'tamper-resistant' the timestream is in his game world(s). This spell is dangerous – the penalties for a failed roll are the same as for Teleport, substituting time for space. Also as in Teleport, the caster can carry no more than Heavy encumbrance (objects and beings). Roll vs. Body Sense skill upon arrival, modifying the roll for changes in velocity, facing, and orientation.

He cannot even cast spells, although he can maintain existing ones. He is likewise immune to magic that does not affect minds or spirits (which the caster is, until he returns to his body). The caster is imperceptible to ordinary senses; only magic (Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense Observation and similar spells) will detect his presence. There is a different spell for travel to each plane or dimension. Which spells exist, and the precise details of the dimensions they lead to, is up to the GM. The subject's senses are altered to correspond to the average plane dweller's; on a plane of perpetual gloom he would have Dark Vision, on the astral plane he would have his senses augmented as per Astral Vision, and on a dimension where all life forms sense only via sound he would have Scanning Sense (Sonar). Visiting very strange alternate planes can be hazardous to the mental health of an unsuspecting traveler ... The most common plane visited in most worlds is the astral, which coexists with the mundane universe and allows visitors to observe real-world places unseen (at least, unseen except by natives of the astral realm, if there are any). While traveling astrally, the caster moves at twice his full unencumbered Speed and may walk through walls, mountains, creatures ... He may also walk down into the bowels of the earth or up into the higher atmosphere.

  "spell-divert-teleport-type": "Blocking; Resisted by subject spell",
  "spell-divert-teleport-description": "When cast on the turn someone or something teleports, timeports, or plane-shifts out, this spell allows the caster to dictate where or when the subject goes. The caster must know the spell he is diverting; he uses the lower of his skill with Divert Teleport and the subject spell. If the caster wants to divert a Teleport into a plane shift (for example), he must know both spells and uses the lowest of his three skills. The resistance is resolved by comparing the margins of success of both spells – if the mage who is teleporting makes his roll by 5, then the mage attempting to divert him must make his roll by 6 or more to succeed. The Divert Teleport takes normal range penalties between the caster of Divert Teleport and the caster of Teleport (or Timeport, etc.), and the standard skill penalty for the destination that the caster wishes to send the teleporter to. The cost to cast the spell is equal to the difference in cost between the teleporter's intended destination and his new destination. If a mage attempts to teleport 40 miles (9 energy), and another mage forces him to another location only 10 yards away (3 energy), the diverting mage will have to pay 6 energy. The same cost would apply if the destinations were reversed. The minimum cost to cast is 3, in any case (high skill will reduce this normally), and the caster pays the full energy cost whether or not the spell succeeds. Example: Suppose Severin knows Teleport at 16 and attempts to teleport 100 yards away to his waiting carriage (skill penalty -2, cost 4). Two yards away stands Elsdon, who knows Divert Teleport at 18 and Teleport at 20, and who would prefer that Severin end up just above a lake which happens to be a mile away (skill penalty -4, cost 7). First, Severin makes his attempt, spending 4 energy and rolling a 10. Since he needed a 14 or less, this is success by 4. Elsdon, using a base skill of 18 (the lowest of his appropriate spells), takes a -2 for being two yards away from Severin, and a further -4 for his intended diversion – his effective skill is 12. He must roll a 7 (succeeding by 5), to win the contest and divert Severin. Whether he does so or not, the calculated cost is 3 energy, so Elsdon must pay the minimum cost of 3.",

The more 'distance' between the gate and its destination, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty. To determine the skill penalty, combine the penalties for the equivalent Teleport, Timeport, or Plane Shift spell(s). To determine the energy cost, combine the energy costs from the same spell(s), and multiply the cost by 10. This cost will permit the caster to create a gate of any size up to a 3' x 6' doorway (or equivalent surface area). Larger gates are no more difficult, but cost proportionately more energy. This spell may also be used to enchant a permanent gate, in which case a few more considerations become important. The caster(s) must specify if it will be always open, always closed, or open and closed when certain conditions are fulfilled (opens only on the hour of the full moon, opens only when someone utters a password, etc). Several gates may share a single location. Only one of them may be open at any time, so it is common to have them cycle in time, giving the net effect of a single gate leading to a choice of destinations. They must be created separately, but otherwise behave as a single gate. Permanent gates can be 'anchored' to a physical gateway; they then resist displacement or destruction at a bonus given by the gateway's DR. When a gate has a Timeport component, the creator must specify if the gate merely displaces its users in time by a fixed amount (1 year into the past, for example) or if it sends its users to a specific, unchanging point in time (December 25, 1066, say). In the latter case, since subjects that step into the gate at various departure times can't all arrive at the same time, the gate either 'drifts' slowly in time so as to space the arrivals at least a second apart, or the various subjects arrive in different 'pasts' (GM's decision).",

The portal leads to a small dimly lit room with blank walls and no visible exits. When the caster wishes to leave, he simply concentrates and a portal appears on one of the walls, leading back to his original point of departure. The space can have a size up to that of a cube equal to the caster's skill, in yards, on a side. The real world completely loses touch with the occupants of the pocket dimension; Seeker won't find them, Trace will lose them for the duration (but will pick them up as soon as they step back out) and so on. Of course, the reverse is also true.  Long-term visits to the pocket dimension will require the creation of air, food, and water (and decent lighting, for comfort's sake), as well as the disposal of wastes. This is slightly complicated by the fact that the pocket dimension is low-mana; all spellcasting is at -5, and the Recover Energy spell doesn't work. Should the spell expire or the caster lose consciousness, all the room's contents reappear as if teleported; its occupants each take 1d of damage and are physically stunned if they fail a Body Sense roll. This also happens to anyone who is foolish enough not to exit before the caster! If the caster wishes to return to the real world, but not to his point of departure, he may cast an appropriate magical transport spell from the pocket dimension as if he were casting it from the departure point (if he is willing to take the risk of a lowmana casting). Note: This 'default' description of the pocket universe created by this spell should by no means be taken as gospel. A less bare-bones version might include opulent (but magical and temporary) furnishings and features, illusionary windows, and so on.

Should the caster die alone in the area, the spell will never end! The caster and any objects caught in the area would simply seem to vanish from the time stream. As far as outside observers are concerned, the area 'ages' instantaneously (which may or may not be perceptible). One moment five ogres were attacking the party while their wizard cast a spell, and the next moment the ogres were dead, the party magically healed, and everybody was in a different position and drinking rum to celebrate. From the inside, the area is bounded by a wall (and covered by a ceiling) of utter blackness. Anyone or anything touching the edge of the area is immediately expelled from the area, back into normal time. This causes an automatic mental stun to anyone other than the caster. Missiles of any sort can be thrown blindly out of the area (see Shooting Blind, p. B389) but not into it. Note that, since all missiles fired out of the area will emerge at the same outside time, an archer could create an impressive burst of arrows by simply firing casually for a few subjective hours ... Spells involving the outside simply fail. Any spell requiring concentration and lying inside the area lapses immediately if its caster is left outside. Likewise, any inside spell whose maintenance comes due during the Time Out lapses unless its caster is also inside.  The 'flow' of mana into the Timed Out area is effectively nil. Powerstones won't recharge, enchantment is impossible, etc. Mages still recover lost energy (the physical consequences of manipulating mana go away regardless of the local mana supply), but GMs may decree that spells cost much more, or are impossible, within the timestopped area (since the power must be drawn entirely from the caster's personal life-force).

  "spell-initiative-description": "This spell can be cast on any creation or illusion the caster controls, giving it a semblance of intelligence in order to act on its own initiative. The subject is totally loyal to the caster, and obeys him (or anyone else the caster orders it to heed) to the best of its ability. The base cost of the spell is based on what knowledge the caster grants the subject. Creations start with their own DX and IQ as listed in the spell description. For the purposes of this spell, Illusions and Phantoms start with IQ 0 and DX 8. The subject's DX and IQ may be raised as high as the caster's. The subject may also be given the caster's skills – every skill granted is known at the same relative level as the caster. Illusions and creations with Initiative may use defaults on any skill. Once the spell is cast, the subject acts on its own until the spell expires. If the subject comes across a situation that confuses it, it attempts to return to the caster for clarification. Like Independence (p. 96), this spell does not count as a spell 'on,' and does not require separate maintenance.  Example: Lady Ann Goulding has created a magical servant to amuse her noble and decadent guests. She wishes it to circulate throughout the party, serving food, dancing with the noblewomen, and showing appropriate respect – without requiring constant supervision, so that she can enjoy herself. It begins with 9 in every attribute, but no skills (Lady Ann could have created a skilled servitor, but she has Create Servant-15 and can maintain an unskilled one indefinitely). To this base she adds 2 points of DX (bringing it up to her own DX of 11), and 2 points of IQ (well below her own IQ of 14) to make it wittier. This is a total attribute increase of 4, for a base cost of 2. Lady Ann then gives it two skills – Dancing and Savoir-Faire. She has Dancing-14 (DX+3), and since the servant has the same DX as she does, the servant will, too. The lady's knowledge of Savoir-Faire is considerable (skill 15, or IQ+1), but the servant is not as smart as she, and will only have it at its own IQ+1, for a net Savoir-Faire13. These two skills add 2 more to the base cost, for a total of 4. Since the servant is less than 1 yard in radius, a casting at base cost will suffice.",

The aura also shows whether the subject has Magery, Magic Resistance, or Magic Susceptibility (and what level); whether the subject is possessed or controlled in any way; and whether the subject is in the grip of any violent emotion. A critical success will detect 'secret' traits, such as lycanthropy, vampirism, and unnatural longevity. All living beings have auras; inanimate things do not. A zombie is detectable by his faint, death-haunted aura, while a vampire retains the aura he had in life. Illusions and created beings have no aura, so a successful casting of this spell distinguishes them from real persons.",

The shade simply came from a different future. Of course, the shade might also reply 'no – it was called off.'

A hit to the eyes does double damage and blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll at a penalty equal to the damage suffered. Treat Sunboltinduced blindness as a crippling injury for recovery purposes (p. B420).

Deliberately reflected shots are a much trickier matter; range penalties will be for the total range to the target, with an additional -2 for each 'bounce.' And unless the mirrors are very large and/or stable and/or deliberately placed for the purpose, the GM may simply declare the shot impossible. Defending characters holding mirrors may attempt to reflect the bolt back at the caster – treat this as a Block defense at a -2 penalty; also apply the normal range penalties from the defender to the caster. The DB of the mirror (if it is large enough to offer any; GM call) adds to this roll normally. The caster may defend normally, unless totally surprised.

The caster must pay full energy and time costs for Throw Spell and its subject at the time of casting; if the caster throws a spell powered for a human-sized subject at a larger subject, there is either no effect or a reduced effect, as the GM sees fit. The caster rolls for the Throw Spell when it is cast; the roll for the subject spell is not made until it is thrown. Thrown spells have 1/2D n/a, Max 80, Acc 1; roll against DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit. All thrown spells take effect at the moment they hit something. Thrown Area spells center on their point of impact. Jet spells take effect at the point of impact, in the direction they were going (treat them as Wild Swings, p. B388). Most other spells simply allow the caster to use spells at longer ranges than normally possible – a thrown Sense Emotion, for instance, or Minor Healing. This spell allows spells that normally require touch to be applied at a distance (Deathtouch, for instance). Missile spells and Blocking spells may not be thrown.

  "spell-delay-description": "This spell is cast on another spell to delay its activation until a certain thing happens in the linked spell's presence – that is, in the presence of the item or area on which the linked spell was cast. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires; if complex, it should be put in writing. The triggering event must be something that could reasonably be determined by a normal person at the Delay site; the GM's decision is final. If the Delay is to be triggered by a more esoteric event, an appropriate spell such as Mage Sight may be cast on the Delay. The Delay may also be triggered by the activation of another spell, such as Watchdog or another linked spell. A Delay can activate only one other spell. The spells are cast one after the other, with no delays between spells. The Delay must be cast first, and counts as a spell 'on' when determining the skill level of the linked spell – see p. 10. Full cost for the linked spell and for the Delay must be paid at the time of casting. If the caster specifies a spell to affect a human-sized subject, and a larger victim (requiring more energy – see p. 11) actually triggers the Delay, there is either no effect or reduced effect, depending on the spell. The GM's ruling on this is final. Delay may be cast two ways: to activate the linked spell on a specific subject, or as a trap, to activate the linked spell against any subject that meets the triggering conditions. In the latter case, the Delay and the linked spell are both cast on a 'trap item,' and range is figured from the trap item at the moment the spell is triggered. Magic Resistance penalties also apply to the linked spell at the time of triggering. The caster rolls for Delay when it is first cast; the roll for the linked spell is not made until the triggering event occurs. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11. So, for instance, the dreaded 'deathtouch doorknob,' set to 'attack' the first person to touch it, would activate at a -5 penalty. When a Delay is triggered, the linked spell begins to activate, taking effect the next turn. Thus, a Delay cannot be used as a Blocking spell. It can be used as a trap; the victim may be taken by surprise. An unsuspecting victim must make an IQ roll to respond before the linked spell is fully activated – Combat Reflexes gives +6 to this roll. Both the Delay and the linked spell count as 'on' for spellcasting purposes; if an Information spell has been added, it is also on. The linked spell does not need to be maintained, though the Delay or its Information spell may need to be. Once the Delay is triggered, it vanishes, and no longer counts as on. The linked spell continues to count as on as long as it is active. It may be maintained normally. A Delay may also be set to 'turn off' an ongoing spell when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell lasts only while the caster maintains it, but the Delay itself requires no maintenance. Blocking and Missile spells cannot be Delayed – all other spells can. An 'instantaneous' spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires.",

  "spell-link-type": "Area",
  "spell-link-description": "Postpones the activation of one or more linked spells cast in its area of effect, until a certain thing happens in the Link's presence. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires, and is governed like Delay (above). The Link may also be triggered by the activation of a spell placed on the area after the Link, such as Watchdog, Delay or another Link. The caster pays the energy costs and makes the skill rolls for the Link spell and all linked spells at the time of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high skill. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11. The size of the area of the Link spell is determined at the time of casting. Any linked spells may go off anywhere within the Linked area; for instance, if a one-yard-radius Create Fire and oneyard-radius Glue spell were linked to a 20-yard-radius Link to catch intruders,  the first intruder to enter the Link's area would find himself in a zone of flaming glue, but subsequent intruders would be safe (from that Link, anyway). The size of the linked spells must be set at the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell either has no effect, or a weaker effect, depending on the spell. The GM's ruling on this is final. Only subjects within the Linked area are affected, unless the spell results in an effect that would not be bound to that area – summoning a demon, for example! The triggering event may occur outside of the area, however. The time to cast the linked spells is spent when initially set up. There is no delay when the Link is triggered – all linked spells are activated instantly. The linked spells do not count as a spell 'on' for any purpose. Every three Link spells on count as one spell on, rounding down. A mage cannot detect a Link simply by looking at it. The Mage Sight spell or the Detect Magic spell will reveal the Link, however. If the mage knows the Conceal Magic spell, the Link may be made harder to detect by magical means. Simply adding the Conceal Magic costs to the base cost of the Link spell accomplishes this effect. The mage must know Conceal Magic to use this option. If the subject of a linked spell is not present at the casting, and has Magic Resistance, refer to the original die roll to determine the results. If the original die roll of the linked spell is not recorded, reroll the spell for this purpose only. Blocking and missile spells cannot be Linked – other spells can. An 'instantaneous' spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires. A single Link can be made to activate a spell when the area is entered, and deactivate the spell when the area is left. This may continue until the linked spell expires. As an example, a mage may cast Link on Continual Light. If he then rolls seven days for the duration of the Continual Light spell (168 hours), he can have the Link set up to turn the Light on when he enters the room, and turn it off when he leaves. When 168 hours of light have been used, both spells expire. For instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes after activating the other spells. No maintenance of a Link is required, either for the Link itself, the linked spells, or any information spells cast on the Link to tell it when to trigger. Link may also be set in reverse, to stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell will last only while the caster maintains it, but the Link itself requires no maintenance. Link can also be used for Limiting Enchantments (see pp. 68-69).",
  "spell-link-duration": "Until triggered, and its linked spells expire.",
  "spell-link-cost": "8; linked spells cannot be maintained.",
  "spell-link-time": "4 hours – there is no reduction in time to cast, no matter how well Link is learned.",
  "spell-reflex-type": "Special",
  "spell-reflex-description": "This spell is cast on another spell. It converts that spell to function as a Blocking spell for one time only, then disappear. Unlike Delay or Link, a Reflexed spell is triggered by the will of the caster, not by an external event. This means that while Reverse Missiles may be Reflexed to activate if the caster sees someone shoot at him, it will not be triggered by a shot in the back. It is treated as an active defense, similar to Parry or Block for all practical purposes (except retreating does not add 3 to the roll). Casting a Reflexed spell will interrupt any spell the caster is concentrating on, and is handled like any other Blocking spell – see pp. 12-13. When Reflex is cast, the linked spell must be cast immediately after Reflex, by the same caster. Each casting of Reflex will only work on one spell – it is not possible to have multiple spells operate as one Blocking spell. The skill roll for Reflex is rolled at the time of casting, but the roll for the linked spell is not made until it is cast as a Blocking spell. The energy cost for Reflex is paid at the time of casting Reflex, but the energy for the Reflexed spell is not paid until it is cast, whether as an active defense or otherwise. The time to cast a Reflexed spell is spent immediately after the Reflex is cast, but the success roll and energy cost are handled later.  A Reflexed spell counts as one spell 'on' for spellcasting purposes – see p. 10. A Reflexed spell does not count as 'on' when making the roll to cast itself. Thus, if a mage has four Reflexed spells on, any other spell he casts is at -4, but when he casts one of the Reflexed spells, it is only at -3 for the other three Reflexed spells on.  Note that a mage may cast a Reflex on another person. The caster (not the subject) may activate it at any time, using long-distance modifiers. If the linked spell is cast on a subject other than the subject of the Reflex itself, the regular modifier for the distance to that subject is added to the longdistance modifier for the caster.  It is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed!  A Reflexed spell may be cast only once. It then disappears, and no longer counts as a spell on. The effects are immediate, and the duration is instantaneous, not the duration listed for the original spell. This means that it is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed! A Force Dome, for example, would stop one physical attack, then disappear – a fatiguing, but effective, defense! A Created Animal will appear, then disappear before it can make any action. (It might stop a missile during its brief existence, however. The GM may rule such an animal must be nearly equal in size to the target it is shielding.) Exceptions to this instantaneousresult rule are spells with permanent results, such as Major Healing – their effects are indeed permanent. Any person may carry any number of Reflexes. However, only one spell may be cast in any one turn. Remember also, that if a Reflexed spell is used as an active defense, no other active defense may be used against that attack, unless All-Out Defense is chosen. See p. B366. A Reflexed spell may be cast as a regular action – it does not have to be cast as a defense. It takes one second to cast, regardless of the time it would normally require to cast. All normal modifiers for distance and Magic Resistance are used when casting the Reflexed spell, if the subject of the Reflexed spell is distant from the person or object the Reflex itself is cast on.  Example: Felix gives Beast-Soother as a Reflexed spell to Rudolph. Felix then activates a Wizard Eye to keep tabs on Rudolph as he goes hunting. Rudolph meets a short-tempered wild boar, which Felix observes through the Wizard Eye. Rudolph cannot activate the spell. Fortunately, he does not have to! Felix activates Beast-Soother as Rudolph tries an Animal Handling roll to calm the boar. Rudolph has gone about two miles into the woods, so Felix is at -3 for long distance. The boar is 3 yards away from Rudolph, so Felix is at another -3 for the range to the subject of the Reflexed spell. He is also at -1 for having Wizard Eye on. Thus, Felix casts Beast-Soother at -7, and pays the energy for the spell at that time. Fortunately he has it at level 21, so he casts it for the maximum effect. The boar is indeed calmed, and Rudolph goes on his way while Felix rests. The Reflexed BeastSoother spell no longer exists. If Rudolph meets another animal, he's on his own, though Felix may still be observing any action with his Wizard Eye. Blocking spells and Missile spells cannot be Reflexed; other spells can be.",

It is under the command of the first person to step aboard it. If there are several beings already aboard when the spell is cast, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see who gets control; the caster (if aboard) gets a +5 bonus to this roll. If the pilot leaves the carpet, roll another quick contest of Will between the remaining passengers to see who gets control. The carpet's maximum Move is equal to the caster's effective skill, and it can handle 1 G turns without skill rolls being necessary (p. B466). Use the Piloting (Contragravity) skill (p. B214) to control the carpet. In general, a rider cannot fall from a flying carpet unless he jumps off deliberately or is knocked off by an obstacle (such as a tree branch) or attack; the carpet keeps its riders safely on board through a combination of magic and deft maneuvering. A flying carpet does not bank sharply, fold, or bend; the spell specifically provides a stable, level platform (which makes flying through narrow gaps rather hard). Any rider engaged in strenuous activity such as fighting must make a DX roll every turn to avoid falling off (the GM may modify this roll depending on the activity). In all other respects, treat anyone fighting from a flying carpet as being on the ground (ignore the special rules for flying combatants on p. B548). Characters aiming a missile weapon from a moving carpet can only take the Acc bonus; aiming for extra turns gives no further bonus. Of course, someone fighting from a flying broom or chair would be subject to the usual penalties for being seated (p. B547) Generous GMs may stipulate that, after the caster cancels the spell, the conveyance remains airborne for 2d+2 seconds, wobbling more with every passing moment.

However, the farther away the target spot is, the more energy is required, and the greater is the skill penalty, as follows: Normally, you may only teleport to a place you are looking at or one you are familiar with. Penalties: -2 for a place you have 'seen' only through the mind or memories of another, or via television; -2 for a place you have not seen within a month (except, perhaps, your own home!); and -1 to -3 for a place seen only briefly. This spell is dangerous, too. If you fail your roll by 1, you take 1d damage and arrive at your destination physically stunned (HT roll to recover). If you miss your roll by more than 1, you suffer no physical injury – but you go somewhere else. The location is up to the GM! A critical failure with this spell can send the caster anywhere the GM likes – make it interesting! – and cause physical injury, as long as it doesn't kill the caster outright. Even a successful teleport can be confusing. A wizard must roll vs. his Body Sense skill (p. B181) in order to act on the same turn in which he teleports. A failed roll means disorientation – no actions except defense are possible on that turn. A critical failure means he falls down, physically stunned. A teleporter arrives in the same position he started in. He may be facing a different direction, but this makes it more likely that he will be disoriented on arrival: -2 to change facing, -5 to go from vertical to horizontal or vice versa! Anything carried on your person, up to 'heavy' encumbrance, goes with you. You can also take one person with you by holding hands, if the added weight does not exceed your 'heavy' encumbrance limit.

The container can be any size, from a small bottle up to an entire building, but it must be fully, tightly closed (watertight is good enough), and the mage must touch it while casting the spell. The spirit cannot resist the spell, but the casting cost is directly proportional to its power. The total cost is equal to the spirit's ST + IQ, divided by 5 to cast and by 10 to maintain. It takes a true effort to restrain a powerful spirit! The caster is informed of the energy cost when the spell takes effect and spends the energy then; if he cannot meet the cost, the spirit is unaffected. If the caster spends half the energy cost, the spirit takes one second to break out of the trap; this is a bad deal, but sometimes buying even a second is a worthwhile thing to do. If multiple spirits are trapped in a single container, add half the others' ST and IQ to the full ST and IQ of the most powerful spirit before calculating cost.

He retains his personality, knowledge, IQ, skills, and spells, and all his mental advantages and disadvantages (including Magery), but gains the physical and supernatural traits of a lich, as determined by the GM. The more powerful that package, the higher the energy cost. After the GM determines the lich template (and hence, the energy cost), the mage casts this spell as with any other enchantment, but with himself as the subject. At the end of the enchanting, he rolls against skill. Any failure does 6d damage to the caster. A success prepares the wizard's body for the next step. To complete the transformation, the would-be lich must drink an alchemical elixir of Lichdom. The elixir of Lichdom is prepared like any other alchemical elixir (see p. 210); it requires $13,500 in materials and 50 weeks of brewing. It defaults to Alchemy-7. Anyone not currently under the effects of a Lich spell who imbibes an elixir of Lichdom is affected as if he had drunk an elixir of Death (p. 215). However, an elixir of Lichdom cannot be counteracted, even with an alchemical Antidote. The elixir of Lichdom is forbidden everywhere, and formularies for it are almost impossible to find; most liches are compelled to reinvent it from scratch. When a wizard under the Lich spell drinks a potion of Lichdom, he must roll vs. HT. If he succeeds, he dies, rising as a lich in 2d days. If he fails, he just dies. Luck, as well as the Bless and Wish spells, can influence this HT roll. This is also an Enchantment spell.  Lich 105 points Attribute Modifiers: ST-1 [-10]; DX+2 [40]; HT+2 [20].

The GM determines the exact abilities of the wraith, but mental traits are preserved as per the Lich spell. The wraith always has a Dependency (p. B130) on the Wraith item (a rare item, required constantly, for -150 points), and shrivels and dies if it is removed or destroyed. This item isn't Hexed; the victim can remove it and die if he wishes. Only Remove Enchantment can reverse the Wraith spell without harm. Each Wraith item can sustain one wraith at a time. Once a given item has produced a wraith, it has no effect on other wearers until its wraith has been destroyed. The Wraith spell has no effect on the undead. At double energy cost, the enchanter can create an item that makes the wraith his undead servant. The wraith automatically gains Reprogrammable (p. B150) with the enchanter as his master in addition to his Dependency, and cannot remove the Wraith item himself.

The range penalty is based on the total distance from source to caster plus caster to sink. If either the source or the sink is not visible to the caster, the roll is at -5; if neither is visible, the roll is at -10! A device may draw power through one mage or circle of mages at a time; if several mages are competing to supply a device, roll a Quick Contest of Skill between casters, adjusting for range. The maximum power a mage may safely serve as a conduit for is (HT) x (Magery squared)/4, in megawatts. Thus, a wizard with HT 10 and Magery 2 could handle a steady stream of 10x(2x2)/4, or 10 megawatts, safely. If a mage's safe level is exceeded, every second he must take 1 fatigue per excess MW (or fraction thereof) and roll vs. HT. On a failed roll, he loses HP equal to the fatigue loss for that turn.

  "advantage-360°-vision-description": "You have a 360° field of vision. You have no penalty to defend against attacks from the sides or rear. You can attack foes to your sides or rear without making a Wild Swing, but you are at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of attack (note that some Karate techniques do not suffer this penalty). Finally, you are at +5 to detect Shadowing attempts, and are never surprised by a danger that comes from behind, unless it also is concealed from sight. Extra eyes are merely a special effect of this trait – you can have any number of eyes, but the point cost remains the same.  Special Limitations Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.  Absolute Direction Mental or Physical 5 or 10 points You have an excellent sense of direction. This ability comes in two levels: Absolute Direction: You always know which way is north, and you can always retrace a path you have followed within the past month, no matter how faint or confusing. This ability does not work in environments such as interstellar space or the limbo of the astral plane, but it does work underground, underwater, and on other planets.

You get the skill bonuses given for Absolute Direction, plus +1 to Piloting and +2 to Aerobatics, Free Fall, and Navigation (Hyperspace or Space). 10 points.  Special Limitations Requires Signal: You rely on signals from a navigational satellite network (like Earth's GPS) or similar system.

Note that things like Daylight Savings Time and calendar reform can still confuse you!

  "advantage-acute-senses-description": "You have superior senses. Each Acute Sense is a separate advantage that gives +1 per level to all Sense rolls (p. 358) you make – or the GM makes for you – using that one sense. Acute Hearing gives you a bonus to hear something, or to notice a sound (for instance, someone taking the safety off a gun in the dark). 2 points/level. Acute Taste and Smell gives you a bonus to notice a taste or smell (for instance, poison in your drink). 2 points/level. Acute Touch gives you a bonus to detect something by touch (for instance, a concealed weapon when patting down a suspect). 2 points/level.  Acute Vision gives you a bonus to spot things visually, and whenever you do a visual search (for instance, looking for traps or footprints). 2 points/level. With the GM's permission, you may also buy Acute Sense advantages for specialized senses such as Scanning Sense and Vibration Sense. You cannot usually buy Acute Senses in play – raise your Perception instead. However, if you lose a sense, the GM may allow you to spend earned points on other Acute Senses to compensate. For instance, if you are blinded, you might acquire Acute Hearing.  DR, add the Armor Divisor enhancement. The victim gets a further +3 if he is beyond 1/2D range. If the victim makes his HT roll, he is unaffected. If he fails, he suffers the effects of the Affliction. By default, he is stunned (see p. 420). He may roll vs. HT+1 once per second to recover, but once again at a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (DR has no effect on this roll). If your Affliction causes an effect other than stunning, this is a special enhancement (see below). You can inflict more than one effect by giving your Affliction multiple special enhancements. These effects occur simultaneously, except where noted.",

  "advantage-affliction-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "advantage-affliction-description": "You have an attack that causes a baneful, nondamaging effect: blindness, paralysis, weakness, etc. This might be an ultra-tech beam weapon, a chemical spray, a supernatural gaze attack, or almost anything else. Specify the details when you buy the advantage. By default, Affliction is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101116). If you hit, your victim gets a HT+1 roll to resist. Apply a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (so Affliction 1 gives an unmodified HT roll). The victim gets a bonus equal to his DR unless the Affliction has one of the following modifiers: Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Cosmic, Follow-Up, Malediction, Respiratory Agent or Sense-Based. To reduce the effects of  Successive Afflictions that produce the same effects are not normally cumulative. Use the single worst effect. Use the special enhancements below to create specific Afflictions. Many Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102) are also logical. For instance, a blinding flash is SenseBased (p. 109); most drugs have Follow-Up (p. 105), Blood Agent (p. 102), or Contact Agent (p. 103); supernatural attacks like the 'evil eye' use Malediction (p. 106); and touch attacks call for Melee Attack (p. 112). If an Affliction produces two or more effects due to the special enhancements below, some of these effects may be secondary. Secondary effects occur only if the victim fails his HT roll by 5 or more or rolls a critical failure. A secondary effect is worth 1/5 as much; e.g., Secondary Heart Attack is +60% rather than +300%. Once you have chosen all the modifiers on your Affliction, describe the nature of the attack as detailed for Innate Attack (p. 61).   Special Enhancements Advantage: The victim immediately experiences the effects of a specific physical or mental advantage. Advantages with instantaneous effects affect the target once, as soon as he is hit, if he fails his HT roll; e.g., Warp immediately teleports the subject. Advantages that can be switched on and off (such as Insubstantiality) are automatically 'on' for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll, and are not under the subject's control. This is worth +10% per point the advantage is worth; e.g., Insubstantiality would be +800%! If the advantage comes in levels, specify the level. Attribute Penalty: The victim suffers temporary attribute loss. This is +5% per -1 to ST or HT, or +10% per -1 to DX or IQ. For instance, an attack that caused DX-3 and IQ-2 would be +50%. Lower all skills based on reduced attributes by a like amount. ST penalties also reduce BL and damage, while IQ reductions also apply to Will and Perception. Secondary characteristics are not otherwise affected; for instance, HT reduction does not affect Basic Speed or FP. Penalties last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll. Coma: The victim collapses, profoundly unconscious, and will likely die in days unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +250%. Cumulative: Repeated attacks are cumulative! You must take this in conjunction with Attribute Penalty, or with an Advantage, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage Enhancement that inflicts a 'leveled' trait. +400%. Disadvantage: The victim temporarily gains one or more specific physical or mental disadvantages (but not self-imposed mental disadvantages – see p. 121). This is worth +1% per point the temporary disadvantages are worth; e.g., Paranoia [-10] is worth +10%. If a disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level. The disadvantages last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll. Heart Attack: The victim suffers an incapacitating heart attack, and will die in minutes unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +300%.  Incapacitation: The victim is incapacitated for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. After that, he is stunned until he can make a HT roll (roll once per second). If you combine Incapacitation with other effects (such as Irritant), those effects occur after the Incapacitation wears off; they replace the stunning and last for the same length of time the Incapacitation did. Incapacitation can take the form of any of the following: Daze, +50%; Hallucinating, +50%; Retching, +50%; Agony, +100%; Choking, +100%; Ecstasy, +100%; Seizure, +100%; Paralysis, +150%; Sleep, +150%; or Unconsciousness, +200%. See Incapacitating Conditions (p. 428) for the game effects. Irritant: The victim suffers an impairing but non-incapacitating condition instead of being stunned. It lasts for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. The possibilities are Tipsy +10%; Coughing, +20%; Drunk, +20%; Moderate Pain, +20%; Euphoria, +30%; Nauseated, +30%; Severe Pain, +40%; or Terrible Pain, +60%. For definitions, see Irritating Conditions (p. 428). Negated Advantage: The victim loses a specific advantage for one minute per point by which he failed his HT roll. There is no effect if the  victim lacks that advantage! This enhancement is worth +1% per point the advantage is worth. If the advantage comes in levels, you must specify the level negated. Stunning: May only accompany Advantage, Attribute Penalty, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage. If the victim fails to resist, he is stunned (per an unmodified Affliction) in addition to the effects of the other enhancement(s). +10%.",
  "advantage-affliction-cost": "10 points/level",
  "advantage-allies": "Allies",
  "advantage-allies-type": "Social",
  "advantage-allies-description": "Many fictional heroes have partners – loyal comrades, faithful sidekicks, trusted retainers, or lifelong friends – who accompany them on adventures. These partners are 'Allies.' The other PCs in your adventuring party are, in a sense, 'allies.' But they can be unreliable allies indeed. Often they are chance acquaintances, first encountered at a roadside tavern only hours ago. They have their own hidden goals, ethics, and motives, which might not coincide with your own. An NPC Ally, on the other hand, is wholly reliable. Perhaps you fought side by side in a long war, trained under the same master, or grew up in the same village. The two of you trust each other implicitly. You travel  together, fight back-to-back, share rations in hard times, and trade watches through the night. Your Ally is usually agreeable to your suggestions, but he is not your puppet. He will disagree with you from time to time. An Ally may try to dissuade you from a plan that seems foolish to him – and if he can't talk you out of the plan, he may refuse to cooperate. An Ally may even cause problems for you: picking fights, landing in jail, insulting a high noble ... Of course, the Ally will also try to bail you out when you make mistakes. The GM will not award you bonus character points for any play session in which you betray, attack, or unnecessarily endanger your Ally. Blatant, prolonged, or severe betrayal will break the trust between you and your Ally, and he will leave you permanently. If you drive your Ally off in this way, the points you spent on him are gone, reducing your point value. Leading your Ally into danger is all right, as long as you face the same danger and are a responsible leader. The point cost for an Ally depends on his power and frequency of appearance. Only PCs who take NPCs as Allies pay points for the privilege. Two PCs can be mutual 'allies' for free, as can two NPCs – and NPCs never pay points for PCs as Allies. An Ally is specifically a skilled NPC associate for one PC.  Frequency of Appearance Whether you pay points for a useful relationship with an NPC or collect points for a troublesome one, it is unlikely that the NPC will be a constant presence. Each friend or foe has a frequency of appearance, and will figure into a given adventure only if the GM rolls less than or equal to that number on 3d at the start of the adventure. How the NPC interacts with you if the roll succeeds depends on the nature of the relationship. Frequency of appearance multiplies the point cost for an Associated NPC (see p. 31) after determining power level and group size (as applicable), but before you apply any special modifiers: Constantly (no roll required): x4. The NPC is always present. This level is reserved for NPCs – usually Allies – that are implanted, worn like clothing, or supernaturally attached. Almost all the time (roll of 15 or less): x3. Quite often (roll of 12 or less): x2. Fairly often (roll of 9 or less): x1. Quite rarely (roll of 6 or less): x1/2 (round up).  Ally's Power Consult the following table to determine how many points you must spend on your Ally. 'Point Total' is the Ally's point total expressed as a percentage of the PC's starting points; 'Cost' is the cost of the Ally. If the Ally's point total falls between two percentages, use the higher. Point Total  Cost 25%          1 point 50%          2 points 75%          3 points 100%         5 points 150%         10 points  Allies built on more than 150% of the PC's starting points are not allowed; treat such NPCs as Patrons (see p. 72). Exception: The progression above extends indefinitely for nonsentient (IQ 0) Allies; each +50% of the PC's starting points costs a further +5 points.  Allies built on no more than 100% of the PC's starting points may also be Dependents (see p. 131). Add the cost of Ally and Dependent together, and treat the combination as a single trait: an advantage if the total point cost is positive, a disadvantage if it is negative.  Allies, or even prohibit groups larger than a certain size – although he might permit an army or other large group as a Patron. Frequency of appearance multipliers and special modifiers (if any) apply to the final cost of the entire group.  Ally Groups  Frequency of Appearance  You may purchase as many Allies as you can afford. Each Ally is normally a separate advantage, but you can treat a group of related Allies as a single trait to save space on your character sheet. For a group of individuals – with their own unique abilities and character sheets – add the costs of the individual Allies to find the cost of the group, adjust the total cost for frequency of appearance, and then apply any special modifiers. For a group of more than five identical and interchangeable allies that share a single character sheet – for instance, an army of low-grade thugs or a swarm of robot drones – find the point cost to have one member of the group as an Ally, and then multiply that cost as follows to find the cost of the group:  Choose a frequency of appearance (see p. 36). If your Ally appears at the start of an adventure, he accompanies you for the duration of that adventure.  Size of Group   Multiplier 6-10            x6 11-20           x8 21-50           x10 51-100          x12  Add x6 to the multiplier per tenfold increase in number (e.g., 100,000 Allies would be x30). The GM may require an Unusual Background (p. 96) if you wish to have hordes of   Allies in Play As with Dependents (p. 131), the GM will adjust your Ally's abilities in order to keep his point total a fixed percentage of your own as you earn points. This will keep his value as an advantage constant. The GM decides how the Ally evolves, although he might ask you for your input. If your Ally dies through no fault of yours, the GM will not penalize you. You may put the points spent on the deceased Ally toward a new Ally. The new relationship should normally develop gradually, but the GM might allow an NPC to become an Ally on the spot if you have done something that would win him over (e.g., saving his life). This is especially appropriate in cultures where debts of honor are taken seriously! There is no penalty for amicably parting ways with your Ally. You may use the points spent on him to buy a new Ally met during play. At the GM's discretion, you may trade in any remaining points for money (see p. 26), reflecting parting gifts.  Familiars Wizards, telepaths, and so on are often supernaturally linked to special Allies known as familiars. These are usually animals or spirits.  You can apply the following enhancements and limitations after calculating group cost (if applicable) and multiplying for frequency of appearance:  Work out a familiar's basic abilities with the GM, starting with the racial template of an ordinary creature of its kind. If its racial IQ is 5 or less, raise it to at least 6. Consider buying off Cannot Speak, if applicable. Most familiars have supernatural advantages: Extra Lives for a cat (it has nine lives, after all!), Mindlink and Telesend for a familiar that can transmit its thoughts, etc. Once you have determined the familiar's abilities, work out its point total and its base value as an Ally. Select frequency of appearance as usual. This may be how often your familiar is available (on a failed appearance roll, it is sleeping, reporting to a demon lord, etc.) or how often its powers work (on a failure, it is no more capable than an ordinary member of its species, and cannot use or grant special powers) – your choice. This kind of Ally usually has one or more special modifiers. Minion, Summonable, and Sympathy are common. Unwilling is typical of demonic or otherwise evil familiars. Take Special Abilities only if your familiar grants you powers; e.g., extra Fatigue Points with which to fuel spells or exotic or supernatural advantages that emulate the familiar's own abilities (such as Flight, for a bird). You have no access to these abilities on a failed appearance roll; if your familiar is stunned, unconscious, or dead; or in areas where your special link does not function (GM's decision). Buy these abilities with a -40% Accessibility limitation: 'Granted by familiar.'  Special Enhancements Minion: Your Ally continues to serve you regardless of how well you treat him. This might be due to programming, fear, awe, or lack of selfawareness. Examples include robots, zombies, and magical slaves. You are free of the usual obligation to treat your Ally well. Mistreatment might result in an inconvenient breakdown (mental or physical), but the Ally will not leave. See Puppet (p. 78) for additional options. +0% if the Minion has IQ 0 or Slave Mentality (p. 154), as the benefits of total loyalty are offset by the need for close supervision; +50% otherwise. Special Abilities: Your Ally wields power out of proportion to his point value. Perhaps he has extensive political clout or access to equipment from a TL higher than your own; perhaps he grants you exotic powers. Don't apply this enhancement simply because your Ally has exotic abilities. If his powers are very uncommon, you will already be paying extra: your Ally requires an Unusual Background, which raises his point total and his value as an Ally. +50%. Summonable: You conjure your Ally instead of rolling to see whether he appears at the start of an adventure. To do so, take a Concentrate maneuver and roll against frequency of appearance. On a success, your Ally appears nearby. On a failure, you cannot attempt to summon him again for one full day. Dismissing your Ally is a free action, but you may only dismiss him if he is physically present. +100%.  Special Limitations Sympathy: If you are stunned, knocked out, mind-controlled, etc., your Ally is similarly affected. The reverse is also true, so you should take special care of your Ally! -25% if the death of one party reduces the other to 0 HP; -50% if the death of one party automatically kills the other. If your wounds affect your Ally, but your Ally's wounds don't affect you, reduce these values to -5% and -10%. Unwilling: You have obtained your Ally through coercion (e.g., blackmail or magical binding). You do not have to treat him as well as you would a normal Ally. However, he hates you and is likely to act accordingly, reducing his overall reliability level. If you endanger such an Ally or order him to do something unpleasant, he may rebel (GM's option) if the consequences of doing so would be less severe than those of doing your bidding. An Ally who rebels is gone, along with the points you spent on him. -50%.",

Out of combat, Altered Time Rate allows you the luxury of extensive planning, even in crisis situations, as everything seems to happen in slow motion. You may always attempt a Sense roll, or an IQ-based skill roll to make plans or recall information (GM's decision), at no penalty to additional actions.  In order to do anything that depends on someone else's reactions, you must deliberately 'slow down' and function at his speed. This applies both when making a Feint in combat and when making an Influence roll (see p. 359) out of combat. For instance, if you choose to Feint, that is all you can do on your turn – you cannot take extra actions.",

Each time you purchase this trait, your fingerprints (or other biometrics used to verify identity in your world) are registered under another name, and you have an extra set of identity documents (birth certificate, licenses, passport, etc.) good enough to pass close inspection. These identities may also have valid credit cards and bank accounts, but you must supply the money – additional wealth is not included in the package! If an intelligence or law-enforcement agency attempts to identify you with no clue as to your name – for instance, using biometrics or photoanalysis – there is an equal chance for each of your identities to come up. The search will stop ... unless they have reason to believe you are a ringer. If the search continues, your other identities will eventually surface, and you will be unmasked. Once a government agency determines who you really are, your Alternate Identities are lost for good. There are two types of Alternate Identity: Legal: Some spies and undercover policemen – and even supers, in settings where they are backed by the government – may have a legal Alternate Identity. This requires at least 10 points in Legal Enforcement Powers, Legal Immunity, Police Rank, Security Clearance, etc.; the GM sets the precise prerequisites. If a super has official permission to conceal his original name (e.g., to protect his family) and to hold property in his 'super' name, then that is a legal Alternate  Identity combined with a Secret Identity (see p. 153). 5 points. Illegal: A criminal or foreign agent may have an illegal Alternate Identity.

You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST. To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of  damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed. To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect (p. 102), Persistent (p. 107), and Wall (p. 109) – and possibly some of the special modifiers below.  Special Enhancements Engulfing: Your attack pins the target. He cannot move his limbs or speak; his only options are to use purely mental abilities, to attack the Binding with an Innate Attack, or to try to break free using ST (not Escape skill). If he tries to break free and fails, he is only allowed a repeated attempt every 10 seconds – and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own! +60%. Only Damaged By X: Only specific damage types can damage your Binding. +30% for one of burning, corrosion, crushing, or cutting; +20% for any two; +10% for any three. Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%. Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%.  Special Limitations Environmental: Your Binding manipulates an existing condition or object in the environment, and won't work in its absence.

After communing with your god (meditating, praying, etc.) for at least one hour, you see visions or witness omens that have some bearing on future events. Work out the details with your GM; for  instance, the God of Fire might require you to stare into flames for an hour, after which you hear a voice in the flames.

Claim to Hospitality mainly saves the cost and trouble of finding lodging while 'on the road' (although if you are wealthy, you might be expected to give gifts to your hosts), but there are side benefits. Members of the group are friendly to each other  (+3 reactions), and may provide advice, introductions, and small loans, if asked.

You can displace all of your ranged senses (for humans: sight, hearing, and smell) to a point outside your body. This 'viewpoint' must be a specific location within 10 yards. You can modify this range with Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). You can double your range temporarily by spending 2 FP per minute. To initiate Clairsentience, pick the desired viewpoint (which can be inside something) and its facing, concentrate for one minute, and then make an IQ roll. If the viewpoint is out of sight, you must specify distance and direction, and the roll is at -5. On a success, you can use your ranged senses as if you were physically present at the viewpoint (this means you cannot sense the environment around your body!). Your vision ignores darkness penalties completely. You cannot see through solid objects, but if your viewpoint were inside (for example) a closed chest, you would see what was inside despite the lack of light. If you are using or subjected to range-dependent abilities (e.g., spells), calculate all ranges from your body, not your viewpoint. You can maintain Clairsentience for as long as you like.

The point value of a Contact is based on the skill he uses to assist you, the frequency with which he provides information or favors, and his reliability as a person.  Effective Skill of Contact First, decide on the type of Contact you have. He might be anything from a wino in the right gutter to a head of state, depending on your background. What is important is that he has access to information, knows you, and is likely to react favorably. (Of course, offering cash or favors is never a bad idea; the GM will set the Contact's 'price.') Next, choose the useful skill your Contact provides. This skill must match the Contact's background; e.g., Finance for a banker or Forensics for a lab technician. Since the GM rolls against this skill when you request aid from your Contact, you should select a skill that can provide the results you expect. If you want ballistics comparisons, take a Contact with Forensics, not Finance! After that, select an effective skill level. This reflects the Contact's connections, other skills, Status, etc. It need not be his actual skill level (the GM will set this, if it matters). For instance, the president of a local steel mill might have business-related skills of 12-14, but his effective skill might be 18 because of his position in the company. This skill level determines the Contact's base cost: Effective Skill  Base Cost 12               1 point 15               2 points 18               3 points 21               4 points  Add 1 point to these costs for Contacts who can obtain information using supernatural talents (ESP, magical divination, etc.). This is common for spirits, wizards, etc.  Frequency of Appearance Select a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36), and apply its multiplier to the base cost of the Contact. When you wish to reach your Contact, the GM rolls against his frequency of appearance. On a failure, the Contact is busy or cannot be located that day. On a 17 or 18, the Contact cannot be reached for the entire adventure! On a success, the GM will roll against the Contact's effective skill once per piece of information or minor favor you request.  No Contact may be reached more than once per day, even if several PCs share the same Contact. If you have several questions to ask, you should have them all in mind when you first reach your Contact. The Contact answers the first question at his full effective skill. Each subsequent question is at a cumulative -2. Don't overuse your Contacts! A Contact can never supply information outside his area of knowledge. Use common sense. Likewise, the GM must not allow a Contact to give information that short-circuits an important part of the adventure. You must explain how you normally get in touch with your Contact. Regardless of frequency of appearance, you cannot reach your Contact if those channels are closed.  Reliability Contacts are not guaranteed to be truthful. Reliability multiplies the Contact's point cost as follows: Completely Reliable: Even on a critical failure on his effective skill roll, the Contact's worst response will be 'I don't know.' On an ordinary failure, he can find information in 1d days. x3. Usually Reliable: On a critical failure, the Contact lies. On any other failure, he doesn't know now, '... but check back in (1d) days.' Roll again at that time; a failure then means he can't find out at all. x2. Somewhat Reliable: On a failure, the Contact doesn't know and can't find out. On a critical failure, he lies – and on a natural 18, he lets the opposition or authorities (as appropriate) know who is asking questions. x1. Unreliable: Reduce effective skill by 2. On any failure, he lies; on a critical failure, he notifies the enemy. x1/2 (round up; minimum final cost is 1 point).  Money Talks Bribery, whether cash or favors, motivates a Contact and increases his reliability level. Once reliability reaches 'usually reliable,' further levels of increase go to effective skill; bribery cannot make anyone completely reliable! A cash bribe should be about equivalent to one day's income for a +1 bonus, one week's income for +2, one month's for +3, and one year's for +4. Favors should be of equivalent worth, and should always be something that you actually play out in the game. The bribe must also be appropriate to the Contact. A diplomat would be insulted by a cash bribe, but might welcome an introduction into the right social circle. A criminal might ask for cash but settle for favors that could get you in trouble. A police detective or wealthy executive might simply want you to 'owe him one' for later ... which could set off a whole new adventure, somewhere down the road.  Contacts in Play You may add new Contacts in play, provided you can come up with a good in-game justification. The GM might even turn an existing NPC into a Contact for one or more PCs – possibly in lieu of character points for the adventure in which the PCs developed the NPC as a Contact. For instance, the reward for an adventure in which the party helped solve a bank robbery might be a knowledgeable, reliable police Contact.  Examples of Contacts  Here are just a few examples: Business. Business owners, executives, secretaries, and even the mailroom flunky can supply information on business dealings. They generally provide a business skill, such as Accounting, Administration, or Finance. A mail boy or typist might have effective skill 12; the president's secretary has skill 15; a senior executive or accountant has skill 18; and the CEO, president, or chairman of the board has skill 21. Military. This could be anyone from an enlisted grunt to a general. Such Contacts might provide information on troop movements, details on secret weapons or tactics, or top-level strategy. This could take the form of SavoirFaire (Military), Strategy, or Tactics skill – or perhaps a technical skill, such as Engineer. A Rank 0 soldier would have effective skill 12, a Rank 12 NCO would have skill 15, a Rank 35 officer would have skill 18, and a Rank 6 or higher officer would have skill 21. Police. Anyone connected with law enforcement and criminal investigations: beat cops, corporate security, government agents, forensics specialists, coroners, etc. Typical skills are Criminology, Forensics, Intelligence Analysis, and Law. Beat cops and regular private security officers have effective skill 12; detectives, federal agents, and records clerks are skill 15; administrators (lieutenants, captains, Special Agents in Charge, etc.) are skill 18; and senior officers (sheriffs, chiefs of police, District Superintendents, Security Chiefs, etc.) are skill 21. Street. Thugs, fences, gang members, mobsters, and the like can provide information on illicit activities, local criminal gossip, upcoming crimes, etc. Most provide Streetwise skill. 'Unconnected' crooks (those who are not part of the local criminal organization) have effective skill 12; 'connected' ones are skill 15; mob lieutenants and other powerful criminals are skill 18; and an actual crime lord (e.g., the Don, clan chief, or Master of the Thieves' Guild) has skill 21.",

These apply to the implant, not to your overall capabilities.",

  "advantage-damage-resistance": "Damage Resistance",
  "advantage-damage-resistance-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "advantage-damage-resistance-description": "Your body itself has a Damage Resistance score. Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armor (you can normally wear armor over natural DR) but before multiplying the injury for damage type. By default, natural DR does not protect your eyes (or windows, if you are a vehicle) or help against purely mental attacks, such as telepathy. Normal humans cannot purchase DR at all. Creatures with natural armor can buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2;  rhinoceros hide or a pangolin's armor plates would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise would have DR 5. Robots, supers, supernatural entities, etc. can purchase any amount of DR, subject to GM approval. Many special modifiers are available to change the basic assumptions of this advantage.  Special Enhancements Absorption: You can absorb damage and use it to enhance your abilities. Each point of DR stops one point of damage and turns it into one character point that you can use to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily. You store these points in a 'battery' with capacity equal to DR (e.g., DR 10 gives a 10-point battery). Once this battery is full, each point of DR will still stop one point of damage, but will not convert it into a character point. You do not have to use stored points immediately, but you cannot reallocate points once used. You lose absorbed points – unused ones first – at the rate of one point per second. You lose enhanced abilities as the points drain away. (Exception: If you are missing HP or FP, you can heal yourself. Restoring one HP drains 2 stored points immediately; restoring one FP drains 3 points. Such healing is permanent. Only HP or FP in excess of your usual scores drain away.) You cannot absorb damage from your own ST or attack abilities. +80% if absorbed points can only enhance one trait (determined when you create your character) or can only heal; +100% if you can raise any trait. Force Field: Your DR takes the form of a field projected a short distance from your body. This protects your entire body – including your eyes – as well as anything you are carrying, and reduces the damage from attacks before armor DR. Effects that rely on touch (such as many magic spells) only affect you if carried by an attack that does enough damage to pierce your DR. +20%. Hardened: Each level of Hardened reduces the armor divisor of an attack by one step. These steps are, in order: 'ignores DR,' 100, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 (no divisor). +20% per level. Reflection: Your DR 'bounces back' any damage it stops at your attacker. The remaining damage affects you normally. The attacker doesn't get an active defense against the first attack you reflect back at him, but gets his usual defenses against subsequent reflected attacks. Reflection only works vs. direct hits! It cannot reflect damage from explosions, fragments, poison gas, or anything else that affects an entire area. This enhancement is mutually exclusive with Absorption. +100%.   Limited Defenses When you buy Damage Resistance – or any advantage that protects against damage (as opposed to nondamaging effects) – you may specify that it is only effective against certain damage types. This is a limitation that reduces the cost of the advantage. Attacks fall into four rarity classes for this purpose: Very Common: An extremely broad category of damage that you are likely to encounter in almost any setting. Examples: ranged attacks, melee attacks, physical attacks (from any material substance), energy attacks (e.g., beam weapons, electricity, fire, heat and cold, and sound), or all damage with a specified advantage origin (chi, magic, psionics, etc.). -20%. Common: A broad category of damage. Examples: a standard damage type (one of burning, corrosion, crushing, cutting, impaling, piercing, or toxic), a commonly encountered class of substances (e.g., metal, stone, water, wood, or flesh), a threat encountered in nature and produced by exotic powers or technology (e.g., acid, cold, electricity, or heat/fire), or a refinement of a 'Very Common' category (e.g., magical energy). -40%. Occasional: A fairly specific category of damage. Examples: a common substance (e.g., steel or lead), any one specific class of damage that is usually produced only by exotic abilities or technology (e.g., particle beams, lasers, disintegrators, or shaped charges), or a refinement of a 'Common' category (e.g., magical electricity, piercing metal). -60%. Rare: An extremely narrow category of damage. Examples: charged particle beams, dragon's fire, piercing lead, ultraviolet lasers, or an uncommon substance (e.g., silver or blessed weapons). -80%. Unless specified otherwise, limited DR works only against direct effects. If you are levitated using magic and then dropped, the damage is from the fall; 'DR vs. magic' would not protect. If a magic sword struck you, 'DR vs. magic' would only protect against the magical component of its damage. Similarly, 'DR vs. trolls' would not help against a boulder hurled by a troll – the damage is from a boulder, not a troll. Be sure to work out such details with the GM before setting the value of the limitation. If the GM feels that a quality would never directly influence damage, he need not allow it as a limitation!   Special Limitations Ablative: Your DR stops damage once. Each point of DR stops one point of basic damage but is destroyed in the process. Lost DR 'heals' at the same rate as lost HP (including the effects of Regeneration, p. 80). Use this to represent supers who can absorb massive punishment but who lack the mass to justify a large HP score. -80%. Can't Wear Armor: Your body is designed in such a way that you  cannot or will not wear body armor or clothing. -40%. Directional: Your DR only protects against attacks from one direction. -20% for the front (F); -40% for the back (B), right (R), left (L), top (T), or underside (U). Humanoids may only take this limitation for front and back. Flexible: Your DR is not rigid. This leaves you vulnerable to blunt trauma (see p. 379). -20%. Limited: Your DR applies only to certain attack forms or damage types. See Limited Defenses (box) for details. Partial: Your DR only protects a specific hit location. This is worth -10% per -1 penalty to hit that body part (see p. 398). For instance, an animal with butting horns and a thick skull might have 'Skull only,' for -70%. 'Torso only' is -10%, and also protects the vital organs. When you take this limitation for arms, legs, hands, or feet, the DR protects all limbs of that type. If it only protects one limb, the limitation value doubles (e.g., arms are -2 to hit, so a single arm would be -40%). If you have arms, legs, etc. with different penalties, use the least severe penalty to calculate limitation value. Semi-Ablative: When an attack strikes semi-ablative DR, every 10 points of basic damage rolled removes one point of DR, regardless of whether the attack penetrates DR. Lost DR 'heals' as for Ablative (and you cannot combine the two). -20%. Tough Skin: By default, Damage Resistance is 'hard': armor plate, chitin, etc. With this limitation, your DR is merely tough skin. Any effect that requires a scratch (e.g., poison) or skin contact (e.g., electrical shock or Pressure Points skill) affects you if the attack carrying it penetrates the DR of any armor you are wearing – even if it does exactly 0 damage! Your natural DR, being living tissue, provides no protection at all against such attacks. This limitation includes all the effects of the Flexible limitation (see above); you cannot take both. It is mutually incompatible with Force Field. -40%.  'Layered' Defenses You may have multiple 'layers' of DR with different combinations of  modifiers. You must specify the order of the layers – from outermost to innermost – when you create your character. You may not change this order once set.",

This is considered an advantage if you are destined for great things – although this might not always be clear, and might even be inconvenient at times. For a disadvantageous Destiny, see p. 131. When you choose this advantage, you may only specify its point value. The GM will secretly determine the nature of your Destiny, according to its point value and the dictates of the campaign. You might discover some clues about your Destiny via magical divination or similar techniques, but you are highly unlikely to learn its full extent until it is fulfilled. Note also that a Destiny may change as the campaign develops. Be aware that this advantage gives the GM absolute license to meddle with your life – the GM must make the Destiny work out! Working out a good Destiny and making sure it comes to pass require considerable ingenuity on the part of the GM. The GM may wish to forbid this advantage if he feels it would send the campaign off the rails. The point value of the Destiny determines its impact: Great Advantage: You are fated to achieve greatness within your lifetime. In the end, everyone will know and praise your name! Sooner or later, something will happen to bring this Destiny to fruition. Note that this does not guarantee 'success.' If you choose to jump in front of an assassin's knife during your first game session, the GM might just decide the Destiny is fulfilled ... you died a hero! 15 points. Major Advantage: As above, but to a lesser extent. Alternatively, you might be doomed to die in a particular place or in a particular fashion: at sea, by the hand of an emperor, underground, or whatever. You can be grievously wounded – even maimed – under other circumstances, but you will not die. If you avoid the circumstances that would fulfill your Destiny, knowingly or otherwise, you might find that Fate has a few surprises. The sea might flood your home while you sleep, the general against whom you march might be the future emperor, or  Mt. Vesuvius might bury you under tons of ash. 10 points. Minor Advantage: You are fated to play a small part in a larger story, but this part will reflect to your credit. In game terms, you are guaranteed one significant victory. 5 points. If you fulfill your Destiny and survive, it's over – but you might feel its repercussions for years to come. In general, the GM should let you put the character points spent on an advantageous Destiny toward a positive Reputation. A Destiny that goes unnoticed once fulfilled is not much of a Destiny!  Detect Mental or Physical; Exotic Variable  You can detect a specific substance or condition, even when it is shielded from the five human senses. This requires one second of concentration, after which the GM will secretly make a Sense roll for you (see Sense Rolls, p. 358). The range modifiers from the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) apply. You may buy a special Acute Sense (p. 35) to improve the roll, thereby increasing your effective range. On a success, the GM tells you the direction to the nearest significant source of the substance, and give you a clue as to the quantity present. On a failure, you sense nothing. Detect also includes the ability to analyze what you detect. This requires an IQ roll; the better the roll, the more precise the details. For instance, if you had Detect (Metal), you could tell gold from iron on a successful IQ roll, and might learn details – such as whether the gold is in the form of ore or bars, and its precise purity – on a critical success. The base cost of Detect is as follows: Rare (sorceresses, fire magic, zombies, gold, radar, radio): 5 points. Occasional (spellcasters, magic, undead, precious metal, electric fields, magnetic fields, radar and radio): 10 points. Common (humans, supernatural phenomena, supernatural beings, metal, electric and magnetic fields): 20 points.  Very Common (all life, all supernatural phenomena and beings, all minerals, all energy): 30 points. Note that the ability to detect certain phenomena can often justify other advantages. For instance, Detect (Magnetic Fields) could explain Absolute Direction.  Special Enhancements Precise: On a successful Sense roll, you also learn the distance to whatever you detect. +100%. Signal Detection: You can detect an active transmission of some sort, such as a radio, radar, or laser; see Scanning Sense (p. 81) and Telecommunication (p. 91). You suffer no range penalties, but must be within twice the signal's own range and (if the signal is directional) within in its path. +0%.

  "advantage-dominance-type": "Mental; Supernatural",
  "advantage-dominance-description": "You can 'infect' others with a supernatural condition – vampirism, lycanthropy, etc. – and exert absolute control over them. This trait is only appropriate for supernatural beings that spread their 'curse' through infection, and only affects members of susceptible races (typically your original race and very similar races). The GM is the judge of which curses are spread this way and who is susceptible. When you buy Dominance, you must specify one natural attack – Claws, Innate Attack, Vampiric Bite, etc. – that delivers the infection. Anyone you damage this way must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury he received (maximum one roll per day). If he rolls under the damage amount, he becomes infected, and will change into the same kind of creature as you in 2d days, or at the GM's discretion, without suitable supernatural intervention. The GM is free to impose additional conditions for infection; for instance, the victim might have to suffer three attacks, or share your blood, or even die before making the roll above. Once the transition is complete, the victim acquires your supernatural racial template (Vampire, Werewolf, etc.) plus Slave Mentality (p. 154). He becomes your subordinate. If he goes on to infect others, his victims will acquire the same traits and serve you as well. Dominance itself costs 20 points, but to control a new victim, you must have sufficient unspent points to buy  him as an Ally (p. 36) with the enhancements 'Minion' (due to his Slave Mentality) and 'Special Abilities' (because he can create new servitors for you). You can choose any frequency of appearance, and may improve this later on with earned points. If you lack the points to buy you victim as an Ally – even at a frequency of '6 or less' – he will still be infected but he will not become your slave. Dominance persists until you die (truly die, for undead), or your slave grows in power and you cannot (or choose not to) spend the points to keep him as an Ally, or the GM rules the curse is broken via supernatural means. If any of these things occur, your victim will lose Slave Mentality  and become free-willed. You may use the points spent on your former Ally to dominate new victims. See Infectious Attack (p. 140) for the disadvantageous form of Dominance.   Duplication Mental or Physical; Exotic 35 points/copy  You can split into two or more bodies ('Dupes'), each possessing your full knowledge and powers (but not copies of your equipment, unless you buy a special enhancement). It takes one second and a Concentrate maneuver to separate or merge. When your Dupes  merge, your FP and HP are the average of all your copies' FP and HP at that time. Your combined self remembers everything experienced by any Dupe. Dupes have no special ability to coordinate with one another. For that, buy Telesend (see Telecommunication, p. 91). If your Telesend works only with your Dupes, you may take the Racial limitation. You may combine Telesend with a Mindlink (p. 70) with your Dupes, in which case you are in constant telepathic contact – no die rolls required. If one of your Dupes dies, all the others immediately take 2d damage and are stunned. This is mental stun if you define Duplication as a mental trait, physical stun if you define it as a physical trait. The IQ or HT roll to recover is at -6. You also lose the points you spent for that Dupe. The GM may allow you to buy back a dead Dupe with unspent points. Alternatively, an Extra Life (p. 55) will let you bring back any one dead Dupe. Your point value drops by the price of the Extra Life, but this is cheaper than buying back a Dupe.  Special Enhancements Duplicated Gear: Your Dupes appear with copies of Signature Gear (p. 85) that you are carrying or wearing. Duplicated equipment vanishes when you merge, even if it becomes separated from you. Treat your equipment's HP, ammunition, energy supply, etc. just like your own HP and FP when you merge. +100%. No Sympathetic Injury: If one of your Dupes is killed, the others are not stunned or hurt. +20%.  Special Limitations Digital: Your Dupes are software copies of your mind, not physical copies of your body. They can possess other computers or occupy spare Puppets (p. 78). You may only take this limitation if you have both Digital Mind (p. 48) and Possession (Digital) (p. 75). -60%. Shared Resources: Your Dupes do not share your full FP and HP; instead, you must distribute your FP and HP among them. For instance, if you had 15 HP and one Dupe, you could split your HP 7 and 8, 2 and 13, or in any other combination that totaled 15. You need not distribute FP and HP proportionally; with 15 HP  and 15 FP, you could give one copy 3 FP and 9 HP and the other 12 FP and 6 HP.

You may also take a half-level of Enhanced Move, either alone or with any whole number of levels; this costs 10 points and multiplies Move by 1.5. Example 1: A super buys Enhanced Move 4 (Ground), for 80 points. He multiplies his Move by 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16. If his Basic Move were 8, he could run at 128 yards/second (262 mph). Example 2: An avian race has Enhanced Move 2.5 (Air), for 50 points. All members of the race multiply their top airspeed by 2 x 2 x 1.5 = 6.  Special Enhancements Handling Bonus: You get a bonus to DX or vehicle operation skill (e.g., Driving) for the sole purpose of maintaining control at speeds above your Basic Move. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +5.  Special Limitations Handling Penalty: You have a penalty to DX or vehicle operation skill at high speeds. -5% per -1, to a maximum of -5.  Extra Attack: The 'default' assumption in GURPS is that you can make one attack per turn, no matter how many limbs you have.  Your multiplied Move is your top speed. Record it in parentheses after your Enhanced Move trait; for instance, the super in the example above would write 'Enhanced Move 4 (Ground Speed 128).' You can always choose to accept a slightly lower top speed if you want your speed to match that of a real-world or fictional creature or vehicle with a known top speed. This does not give you back any points. Enhanced Move does not affect Basic Speed, Basic Move, or Dodge. Its benefits apply only when moving along a relatively straight, smooth course (see Sprinting, p. 354). It does have some defensive value, however: those who attack you with ranged attacks must take your speed into account when calculating speed/range modifiers (see p. 550). Most forms of Enhanced Move have prerequisites. Enhanced Move (Water) requires Amphibious (p. 40) or Aquatic (p. 145). Enhanced Move (Air) requires Flight (p. 56). Enhanced Move (Space) requires Flight with the Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight enhancement, and affects movement in space – not airspeed. To move faster in air and in space, buy both Enhanced Move (Air) and Enhanced Move (Space).   Newtonian: This is a limitation for Enhanced Move (Space). Your space 'top speed' is actually your 'delta-v': the total velocity change you can manage before running out of reaction mass. Once you have made velocity changes equal to your top speed, you must refuel before you can change velocity again. -50%. Road-Bound: This is a limitation for Enhanced Move (Ground).

  "advantage-enhanced-time-sense-description": "You can receive and process information dramatically faster than the human norm. This improves your mental speed – notably your reaction time – but not how fast you physically  move once you react. This has several game benefits. First, Enhanced Time Sense (ETS) includes Combat Reflexes (p. 43), and provides all the benefits of that advantage. You cannot buy Combat Reflexes if you have ETS; the two advantages are not cumulative. In combat, you automatically act before those without ETS, regardless of Basic Speed. If more than one combatant has ETS, they act in order of Basic Speed, and they all get to act before those who lack ETS. You can perceive things that happen too fast for most people to discern. For example, you cannot be fooled by a projected image, because you can see the individual frames of the film. If secret information is being sent as a high-speed 'burst,' you can detect it if you're monitoring the transmission (you cannot necessarily decipher it, but you know it's there). At the GM's discretion, you get a Sense roll to spot objects moving so fast that they are effectively invisible; for instance, bullets in flight. ETS is extremely valuable if you possess magical or psionic defenses that work at the speed of thought. If you have ETS, your rapid thought processes always allow you to ponder a problem thoroughly and respond in the manner you think best. You never suffer skill penalties for being mentally 'rushed' – although you still need the usual amount of time to complete a physical task, and suffer the usual penalties for hasty work. The GM can almost never tell you to make up your mind right now. (But don't abuse this privilege by taking half an hour to decide what to do in each turn in combat!) The exception is when something happens so fast that most people can't perceive it at all. In that case, the GM is justified in asking you for an immediate response, since those without ETS get no response. ETS does not 'slow down' the world from your viewpoint. You can still enjoy a movie by simply ignoring the frames, much as a literate person can choose whether or not to notice the individual letters in the words he's reading. ETS also does not let you violate the laws of physics. Some things (e.g., laser beams) simply travel too fast for you to react.",

No matter how many arms you have, though, you do not get additional attacks (or other extra maneuvers) in combat unless you buy Extra Attacks (see below).  Close Combat With Extra Arms Extra arms give a huge advantage in close combat. You cannot punch with more than one arm at a time unless you have Extra Attack, but you may grapple with all of your arms at once. Each extra arm of regular length or longer, over and above the generic set of two, gives +2 to any attempt to grapple or break free from a grapple. Having more arms than your opponent also gives +3 on any attempt to pin or resist a pin.  Special Enhancements  In GURPS, a limb with which you can manipulate objects is an arm, regardless of where it grows or what it looks like. A normal arm can strike a blow that inflicts thrust-1 crushing damage based on ST. The human norm is two arms for 0 points. Extra arms have a base cost of 10 points apiece.  Extra-Flexible: Limbs with this enhancement are more flexible than human arms, like tentacles or an elephant's trunk. These limbs can always reach and work with other limbs, regardless of body positioning, general layout, or 'right' and 'left.' +50%. Long: Your arm is longer in proportion to your body than a human arm relative to the human body.

You can also use all of your arms in concert for a single combat maneuver where extra arms would be helpful; e.g., grappling in close combat. And if you have at least three arms, you can use a shield normally with one arm and still wield a two-handed weapon, just as a normal human fighter can  Foot Manipulators: Your 'arm' is really an unusually dextrous leg. You cannot walk while you are manipulating objects with it (although you can sit, float, or fly). This is a Temporary Disadvantage limitation, the disadvantage being Legless (p. 141). This kind of arm is usually – but not always – Short (see below). -30%. No Physical Attack: The limb can manipulate but cannot punch or wield melee weapons, and gives no bonus in close combat. It can still wield a firearm or similar ranged weapon. -50%. Short: The arm has reach 'C' (close combat only), and lacks the leverage to use any weapon that must be  swung.

Modifying Beings With One or Two Arms Beings with one or two arms can use the special modifiers above. Point cost is equal to 1/10 the percentile modifier per affected arm.

The GM's word on what constitutes an 'attack' is final. A normal human can purchase one Extra Attack. This lets him attack with  both hands at once, and represents unusually good coordination. Supers and nonhumans have no such limitation. A super-powered cop could buy two Extra Attacks, enabling him to shoot rays from his eyes, fire his pistol, and swing his nightstick all at once. A dragon might take four Extra Attacks and attack five times with any combination of his four clawed limbs, teeth, horns, tail, and fiery breath! Extra Attack is exactly that: an extra Attack maneuver on your turn in combat.

This works at any altitude where there is still significant atmosphere – but in the upper atmosphere, you'll need a way to survive in very thin, cold air (e.g., Doesn't Breathe and Temperature Tolerance). You cannot fly in a trace atmosphere or vacuum. Your flight Move is Basic Speed x 2 (drop all fractions). As explained in Move in Other Environments (p. 18), you can adjust this for ±2 points per ±1 yard/second. For very high speeds, take Enhanced Move (Air). If you do not have any of the Controlled Gliding, Gliding, Lighter Than Air, Small Wings, Space Flight Only, or Winged Flight limitations, you can also 'fly' at half-speed underwater. Flight includes the ability to hover at Move 0 as well. Flight does not confer the ability to do complex acrobatics and tight turns; for that, buy Aerobatics skill (p. 174). Flight skill (p. 195) improves endurance. You can alter most of the above assumptions through special modifiers.  Special Enhancements Newtonian Space Flight: As Space Flight (below), except that your space Move – or your space top speed, if you have Enhanced Move (Space) – is actually your 'delta-v': the total velocity change you can manage in space before running out of reaction mass. For instance, you could accelerate up to your delta-v and stay there (like a missile), or to half your delta-v and then decelerate to a stop at the end of your trip (like a conventional spacecraft). Once you have made velocity changes equal to your delta-v, you must refuel before you can change your velocity in space again. +25%. Space Flight: You can fly in space or a vacuum (such as on the moon). Your space Move is Basic Speed x 2. If you want to be able to accelerate constantly to reach a higher top speed, like a rocket, buy Enhanced Move (Space) (p. 52). This will let you accelerate or decelerate each turn by an amount equal to your space Move, up to your enhanced top speed. For a 'realistic' space move that lets you accelerate indefinitely in a vacuum (up to the speed of light), you'll want Enhanced Move 25-27 (Space). This is incompatible with all other special modifiers except Space Flight Only. +50%.  Special Limitations Cannot Hover: You must always move at least 1/4 your top airspeed (round up) when flying. This is incompatible with Controlled Gliding and Gliding. -15%. Controlled Gliding: Like Gliding (below) in most respects, but you can gain altitude by riding updrafts or 'thermals.' A typical ascent rate is one yard per second. You can locate thermals, if any are present, on a successful IQ or Meteorology roll (one attempt per minute). -45%. Gliding: You cannot gain altitude. With a running leap, you can launch yourself with an air Move equal to Basic Move. Each turn, you can change velocity by up to 10 yards/second x local gravity in Gs (Earth's gravity is 1G). To accelerate, you must descend by 1 yard for each 1 yard/second added to velocity; top speed is Basic Move x 4 (but you can go faster if towed). To decelerate, you must fly level. If you do not descend at least 1 yard, you automatically decelerate by 1 yard/second that turn. When working out turning radius, your basic air Move is 10 x local gravity in Gs. Each  level of Enhanced Move (Air) either doubles top speed or halves deceleration in level flight (e.g., one level means you only lose 0.5 yard/second in level flight); specify which when you buy it. -50%. Lighter Than Air: You fly by becoming lighter than air (or gaseous). A wind moves you 1 yard/second, in the direction it is blowing, per 5 mph of wind speed. If the wind happens to be blowing in the direction you wish to travel, this adds to your Move; otherwise, your Move goes down as you fight against the breeze. -10%. Low Ceiling: You cannot fly very high. This does not limit speed in any way, but the GM may require Aerobatics rolls to dodge obstacles near the ground. A 30-foot ceiling is -10%; a 10-foot ceiling is -20%; and a 5-foot ceiling is -25%. Small Wings: As Winged (below), except that your wingspan is no more than half your height. You use your wings to steer and to stabilize your flight – not to lift. If your wings are crippled in flight, roll against Aerobatics skill (or default) to land safely. -10%. Space Flight Only: You can only take this in conjunction with Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight. You can fly only in space; you have air Move 0 in atmosphere. You require a boost to reach space from any planet with an atmosphere, and are incapable of atmospheric reentry. -75%. Winged: You use large wings or skin flaps to fly. Wingspan is at least twice your height. In order to take off, land, or maneuver, you must have an open area with a radius equal to your wingspan in all directions. If your wings are bound, or if a wing is crippled (more than 1/3 of your wings, if you have more than two), you cannot fly. Treat wings as arms for the purpose of targeting and crippling.

You suffer only half the usual DX penalty for different gravity (see Different Gravity, p. 350). In situations where low gravity would make a task easier, you roll at full DX, plus the bonus for low gravity, plus an extra +1. For instance, if a normal person would get +2 to catch a ball in low gravity, you would get +3.  1. An item you own but did not specifically state you were carrying. For instance, if you own a handgun, and get ambushed while driving to church, you could pull out your pistol – even if the police searched your vehicle five minutes ago and found no weapons! 2. An item that you probably own, and that is in keeping with your character concept, but that is minor or ignorable enough to leave unspecified. For instance, a policeman might happen to be carrying a spare handcuff key, while a wizard might have some eye of newt. The GM has the final say, but should be lenient if the item you wish to have is consistent with your character story. 3. An inexpensive device widely available at your tech level. For instance, if you need to light the fuse on some dynamite, you could pull out a box of matches – and they would work, even if you just took an involuntary swim in the creek. Each Gizmo you can use per game session (maximum of three) costs 5 points. Note that this ability is not realistic! The GM may wish to limit it further, or forbid it, in a realistic campaign.  Gadgeteers and Gizmos Those with the Gadgeteer advantage (p. 56) have more latitude. In addition to the usual items available, a Gadgeteer may specify that his Gizmo is one of his inventions (which must still be small). Instead of pulling an existing gadget 'out of his pocket,' a Gadgeteer can use his Gizmo to let him build what he needs on the spot. He must still possess or find the appropriate materials, and know any required skills. The GM should roll secretly against the relevant skill, at -2 or worse. A failed roll means the device doesn't work (this still 'uses up' the Gizmo). A critical failure means the device backfires spectacularly!

  "advantage-growth-description": "You can grow – really grow! As your size increases, so must your ST (or you would collapse under your own weight). Your equipment doesn't change size! Each level of Growth lets you increase your Size Modifier by +1. Find your final height from the Size Modifier Table (p. 19). Increases in SM affect your arm and leg length when calculating reach and determining whether you can negotiate obstacles; see Size Modifier and Reach (p. 402). It takes one second to modify your SM  by +1 (or by -1 as you return to normal size). If you attempt to grow in a room, vehicle, container, etc. that isn't large enough to hold you, your growth normally stops. However, if maximum thrust damage for your current ST is greater than the wall or ceiling's DR, you burst through it. This takes one second per point of DR. You must buy the ST necessary to support your form separately. This is 5 x final height in yards. If your ST increases with height and is only available when you grow, you may buy it with the Size limitation (see Strength, p. 14). Use your maximum SM to determine the limitation value. At intermediate SMs, find your height as a fraction of your maximum height. This is the fraction of your extra ST available to you at that SM (round down).   Example: A 6'-tall character (SM 0) has Growth 4. He can grow to SM +4, giving him a maximum height of 10 yards. He must buy ST 50 to support himself. If he has ST 15 and gains +35 ST only at full height, he may buy his +35 ST with a -40% Size limitation. At SM +1, he will be 3 yards tall. This is 30% of his final height, so he will have 30% of +35 ST, or +10 ST, for ST 25. Similarly, he'll be 5 yards tall with ST 32 at SM +2, 7 yards tall with ST 39 at SM +3, and 10 yards tall with ST 50 at SM +4.  Special Modifiers Maximum Size Only: You can only assume normal or maximum size.  Instead of growing at +1 SM per second, you grow to your maximum SM – or revert back to your usual SM – in one second.

Roll at -2 if the subject is unconscious. You can use Healing in two ways: Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP per 2 HP healed (round up). Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to the crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead. Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM – from +1 for the common cold to -15 for AIDS. The FP cost is equal to twice the penalty, minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll. If used more than once per day on a given subject, apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of the same type  (injury or disease) on that subject. This penalty accumulates until a full day has passed since the most recent healing. Healing works on your own race and on all 'similar' races. In a fantasy campaign, for instance, all warmblooded humanoid races (elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings, etc.) would be 'similar.'   Special Enhancements  Faith Healing: Your power works by channeling spiritual energy. This lets you cure anyone the spirits or gods deem worthy of healing, regardless of race. However, you (and possibly your subject) must behave in a manner consistent with the interests and moral codes of your supernatural allies, or this ability will not work. You may not combine Faith Healing with Own Race Only or Xenohealing. +20%. Xenohealing: You can heal beings quite dissimilar from yourself.

Most foes (GM's decision) cannot slam or grapple you! Diffuse includes all the benefits of No Blood, No Brain, and No Vitals. 100 points. Homogenous: Your body has no vulnerable internal organs, bones, muscles, or other mechanisms. As a result, you are less susceptible to piercing and impaling attacks; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). Homogenous includes the benefits of No Brain and No Vitals. This trait is intended for  entities such as iron golems, trees, and slimes. 40 points. No Blood: You do not rely upon a vital bodily fluid (like blood) for survival. You do not bleed (see Bleeding, p. 420), are unaffected by blood-borne toxins, and are immune to attacks that rely on cutting off blood to part of your body. 5 points. No Brain: Your brain – if you have one – is distributed throughout your body, or isn't your true seat of consciousness. Your opponents cannot target it for extra damage. You may have a head, but a blow to the skull or eye is treated no differently than a blow to the face (except that an eye injury can still cripple that eye). 5 points. No Eyes: You lack eyes or other vulnerable optics, but can somehow see despite this (unless of course you suffer from Blindness, p. 124). As you have no eyes, they cannot be attacked. You are also immune to blinding attacks. 5 points. No Head: You have no head at all. This includes the benefits of No Brain.

Specify how you do this (supernaturally, technologically, via organs on your torso, etc.). It is common – but not mandatory – for those with No Head to have No Neck, No Eyes, or both. 7 points.

  "advantage-innate-attack-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "advantage-innate-attack-description": "You have a natural or built-in attack with which you can inflict  physical damage (for nondamaging attacks, see Affliction, p. 35, and Binding, p. 40). Examples include a dragon's fiery breath, a robot's built-in blaster, and a god's ability to hurl lightning bolts. By default, this is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). An Innate Attack inflicts 1d damage per level. Its cost per level depends on the type of damage it inflicts:  Burning (burn) Your attack inflicts damage using flame, an energy beam, or localized electrical burns. It may ignite fires! 5 points/level.  Cutting (cut) Your attack inflicts lacerations, like those caused by an axe or broken glass. Multiply penetrating damage by 1.5. Cutting attacks can inflict blunt trauma and cause knockback. 7 points/level.  Fatigue (fat) Your attack is nonlethal. It might involve a low-amperage electric shock or a 'mind blast,' or even inflict a weakening effect such as hypothermia or starvation. It reduces FP, not HP, and cannot affect machines. 10 points/level.  Alternative Attacks If you have multiple Innate Attacks, you may define them as being the same basic attack, but with different settings, ammo types, etc. Determine the cost of these 'alternative attacks' as usual, but only pay full price for the most expensive attack. Buy additional attacks at 1/5 cost (round up). This can save a lot of points, but there are drawbacks. First, since the attacks represent a single ability, you cannot use them simultaneously, even if you are capable of multiple attacks. This also prevents you from combining them with the Link enhancement (p. 106). As well, any critical failure or malfunction that disables one of your attacks disables all of them. Finally, if your most expensive attack is somehow drained or neutralized, none of the cheaper attacks will work. You may also apply this rule to multiple Afflictions (p. 35) or Bindings (p. 40), or any combination of these with Innate Attacks that you cannot use simultaneously. With the GM's permission, you can apply this rule to multipurpose Strikers (p. 88) as well.  Corrosion (cor) Your attack involves acid, disintegration, or something similar. For every 5 points of basic damage you inflict, reduce the target's DR by 1, in addition to regular damage. (Living beings heal natural DR at the same rate as HP.) 10 points/level.  Crushing (cr) Your attack inflicts damage through blunt impact, like a bludgeoning weapon or an explosive blast. It is likely to cause knockback (p. 378), and is more effective at inflicting blunt trauma (p. 379) than other types of damage. 5 points/level.   Impaling (imp) Your attack inflicts stab wounds, like a spear or an arrow. Double penetrating damage in flesh! Impaling attacks can target the eyes and vital organs, can inflict blunt trauma, and may slip through high-tech flexible armor. 8 points/level.  Piercing Your attack involves a fast, blunt projectile, such as a bullet, or is sharp but too small to qualify as impaling, like a dart or a stinger. It may inflict blunt trauma, and can target the eyes and vital organs. There are four subclasses of piercing attack:    Small Piercing (pi-): Use this for very low-energy projectiles (e.g., blowgun darts), or for attacks that tend to punch through the target and leave a small wound channel (e.g., armorpiercing bullets). Against flesh, halve damage that penetrates DR. 3 points/level. Piercing (pi): Use this for most rifle and pistol bullets. 5 points/level. Large Piercing (pi+): Use this for attacks similar to large-caliber solid bullets, or for smaller projectiles that create large wound channels (e.g., hollow-point bullets). Multiply penetrating damage in flesh by 1.5. 6 points/level. Huge Piercing (pi++): Use this for attacks that leave an even larger wound channel than large piercing. Double penetrating damage in flesh! 8 points/level.   Description After applying all relevant modifiers, name and describe the attack. You can be as general as 'dragon fire' or as specific as '9mm machine pistol cybernetically implanted in right arm.' At the GM's discretion, the description can imply additional noncombat abilities; for instance, a jet of high-pressure water could put out fires. The GM has the final say as to whether your description fits the campaign setting, and may modify the attack if necessary.   Toxic (tox) Your attack inflicts cellular damage, in the manner of disease, poison, or radiation. It cannot normally affect machines. The modifiers Cyclic (p. 103), Onset (p. 113), and Resistible (p. 115) are usual, but not required. 4 points/level.  Partial Dice You do not have to buy wholenumbered dice of damage. Each ±1 to damage counts as ±0.3 dice. Round the final cost up. For instance, an Innate Attack that does 1d+2 damage counts as 1.6 dice. If it were crushing (5 points/die), it would cost 1.6 x 5 = 8 points. Some attacks do only 1 point of damage. This counts as 0.25 dice. Once again, round cost up. Such attacks can still be deadly – especially if they involve the Follow-Up (p. 105) or Cyclic (p. 103) enhancement!  Special Modifiers Many special modifiers for Innate Attack appear under Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102). You can use these to create almost any attack – built-in guns, lasers, jets of liquid fire, gale-force winds, etc. – and to duplicate the capabilities of weapons listed in GURPS books. Fatigue and toxic attacks intended to simulate poison or disease require modifiers. Noxious agents on Claws (p. 42), Teeth (p. 91), darts, etc. use Follow-Up (p. 105). Gases and sprays use Respiratory Agent (p. 108) or Contact Agent (p. 103), often with Area Effect (p. 102), Cone (p. 103), or Jet (p. 106). Attacks that depend on touch or on skin contact use Blood Agent (p. 102) or Contact Agent, plus one of Aura (p. 102) or Melee Attack (p. 112). Regardless of other modifiers, Innate Attacks are treated as ranged attacks unless given the Melee Attack limitation; then they're considered melee weapons.        Insubstantiality Mental or Physical; Exotic 80 points  You can become intangible, passing through solid objects as though they weren't there. In this state, gravity does not affect you – you can move in any direction at full Move (and make no noise when you move). You can perceive the tangible world, and speak normally to those within it, but you cannot pick up normal objects or affect them in any way. Physical and energy attacks cannot harm you, but you're still vulnerable to psionic and (nonmaterial) magical attacks. Likewise, your physical and energy attacks cannot affect physical opponents. Your psi abilities and magic spells can affect the physical world, but at -3 to all skill rolls. Although you can pass through solids, you must still breathe. When moving through a solid object, treat this as if you were swimming underwater for purposes of suffocation. You cannot materialize inside a solid object. Your 'natural' form (physical or insubstantial) is considered a special effect. You must take this advantage if you can change between a physical and an insubstantial form. This trait can represent any number of abilities from folklore and fiction. You should work out its origins (see p. 33) and special effects with the GM – perhaps you 'vibrate' out of synch with reality, phase into a different dimension, or become a spirit. This determines your appearance, which may be transparent, misty ... or completely normal (but you can't be invisible without the Invisibility advantage). Your physical and energy attacks affect other beings using the same form of Insubstantiality, and their attacks affect you. The GM may rule that certain materials, energy barriers, magic spells, etc. are impenetrable to your particular form of Insubstantiality.  Special Enhancements Affect Substantial: If you have any abilities that can affect the substantial world when you are insubstantial – including magic, psionics, or powers with the Affects Substantial enhancement (p. 102) – this advantage costs more. +100%. Can Carry Objects: Normally, you cannot carry anything while insubstantial. This enhancement lets you carry objects, including clothing and armor. They become physical if dropped. You cannot materialize these objects inside other objects or characters. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%. Partial Change: You can turn part of your body substantial while other parts remain insubstantial, or vice versa. Thus, you could reach through a wall and tap someone on the shoulder. If you also have Can Carry Objects, you can materialize your  hand, pick up material objects, and carry them while insubstantial. +20%, or +100% if you can turn an item you are carrying substantial without dropping it (this requires turning your hand substantial, too).  Special Limitations Always On: You are always insubstantial and cannot materialize. If you have this limitation, there is no -3 to use magic or psionics. -50%. Usually On: Similar to Always On, but you can materialize for short periods with great effort. Materialization costs 1 FP per second. -40%.",

  "advantage-intuition-type": "Mental",
  "advantage-intuition-description": "You usually guess right. When faced with a number of alternatives, and no logical way to choose among them, you can ask the GM to let you use your Intuition. The GM makes a secret IQ roll, with a bonus equal to the number of 'good' choices and a penalty equal to the number of 'bad' choices. On a success, he steers you to a good choice; on a critical success, he tells you the best choice. On a failure, he gives you no information; on a critical failure, he steers you toward a bad choice. The GM can modify this as he sees fit for other situations where Intuition might logically help. Only one roll per question is allowed. The GM should never allow Intuition to short-circuit an adventure – for instance, by letting the intuitive detective walk into a room, slap the cuffs on the guilty party, and close the case. At the most, Intuition would point the detective in the direction of a good clue. GMs who don't think they can control Intuition should not allow it in their games.     Invisibility Mental or Physical; Exotic 40 points  You are invisible. Unlike most advantages, this one is 'always on' unless you take a special enhancement. You still make noise, leave footprints, and have a scent – and by default, anything you carry remains visible. If you are carrying nothing, you get a +9 to Stealth in any situation where being seen would matter.  Individuals using paranormal remote viewing (crystal balls, Clairvoyance, etc.) cannot see you if you would be invisible to their normal vision. Devices with these powers can still sense you, as can paranormal abilities that detect enemies, life, and so on nonvisually. Invisibility only works against one sort of vision. Types include electromagnetic vision (which encompasses ordinary vision, Infravision, Ultravision, and radar), sonar, magnetic fields, and anything else the GM comes up with. If you are invisible to electromagnetic vision, you do not cast a shadow and don't show up in mirrors.   Special Enhancements  Affects Machines: You are invisible even to machines. You cannot be photographed, and you don't show up on cameras or other detectors. Devices such as pressure plates still notice you, but you could walk past a robot sentry undetected. Electronically targeted weapons get no bonuses to hit you. +50%. Can Carry Objects: The objects you carry, including clothing and armor, become invisible. They regain visibility when put down. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%. Extended: You are invisible to more than one type of vision (for instance, electromagnetic vision and magnetic fields). +20% per additional type of vision. Switchable: You are normally visible, but can become invisible at will. +10%. Usually On: You are normally invisible, but can become visible for short periods with great effort. Turning visible costs 1 FP per second. +5%.  Special Limitations  Machines Only: Similar to Affects Machines, but you are only invisible to machines. Living beings can see you normally. -50%. Substantial Only: Your invisibility only hides you in the material world. Insubstantial beings (ghosts, etc.) can see you normally. -10%. Visible Reflection: You can be seen in mirrors! -10%.

  "advantage-jumper": "Jumper",
  "advantage-jumper-type": "Mental; Supernatural",
  "advantage-jumper-description": "You can travel through time or to parallel worlds (sometimes known as 'timelines') merely by willing the 'jump.' Decide whether you are a time-jumper or a world-jumper. To do both, you must buy Jumper (Time) and Jumper (World) separately, at full cost. To initiate a jump, you must visualize your destination, concentrate for 10 seconds, and make an IQ roll. You may hurry the jump, but your roll will be at -1 per second of concentration omitted (-10 to jump with no preparation at all). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination, which can be any time or world the GM wishes! You appear at your destination at exactly the same place you left your previous time or world – or as close as possible. When jumping through time, this means the same place at a different time. When jumping between worlds, this means the same place at the same time, but on a parallel world. If there is no corresponding 'safe' location within 100 yards of your destination – for instance, if you jump while on an airplane to a destination with no plane at your location, or from a half-mile deep mine to a destination with no corresponding mine – the jump will fail and you will know why it failed. This does not prevent you from jumping into other types of danger, such as radiation, gunfire, or wild animals. If you have Danger Sense, the GM should roll before you make a hazardous jump; on a success, you get a warning. This ability always costs at least 1 FP to use, whether it succeeds or fails. Particularly 'distant' times or worlds might cost more, perhaps up to 10 FP, at the GM's discretion. If you are a machine, this ability does not cost you FP – but if you have passengers, each of them must pay the FP cost. For an example of how Jumper might work in a particular game world, see World-Jumpers (p. 544).  Carrying Things You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (see  p. 74). Take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below) if you wish to carry more weight, or bring along other people. However, if multiple Jumpers of the same kind are in physical contact, when one jumps, the others can 'hitch a ride' if they wish – even if the Jumper who initiates the jump does not want company. Only the person initiating the jump makes a die roll; wherever he ends up, the others do, too. If you are a world-jumper, 'hitching a ride' is the only way to visit a new parallel world (save for a critical failure!). However, once you reach a world, you can memorize its 'feel' by concentrating and spending character points to 'learn' that world as an IQ/Easy skill. This takes one hour per point you wish to spend. Use this skill in place of IQ when you travel to that world in the future. You never have to memorize a world, but if you do not, you roll at IQ-3 to attempt to return. Time-jumpers have no similar restriction. You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. GMs who do not want the PCs jumping multiple times per adventure are free to impose mandatory limitations (e.g., Limited Use) that cannot be bought off.  Special Enhancements Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; ExtraHeavy, +50%. New Worlds: This is only available for world-jumpers. You can deliberately aim for worlds you haven't visited. The IQ roll is always at -3 or worse (GM's decision). Of course, it is always possible that the desired destination does not exist, in which case the attempt automatically fails – although the GM will not tell you why. All FP costs are doubled when using this enhancement. +50%. Omni-Jump: This is only available if you are both a world-jumper and a time-jumper! You must apply it to both Jumper advantages. This lets you move between times and timelines on  a single IQ roll – for instance, from the present day in our timeline to 1066 A.D. in a parallel timeline where the Norman invasion of England failed. +10%. Tracking: You can travel to the 'home' time or world of any manmade artifact you can hold or touch. Time-jumpers will arrive shortly after the item was created; world-jumpers will arrive at the current date on the item's home timeline. Any such attempt is at IQ-2, and each Jumper only gets one try per artifact. +20%. Tunnel: You always create a portal (of about your size) when you jump. Others may pass through it, even if they can't jump. The portal lingers for 3d seconds, which can be good or bad – it means enemies can follow you! +40%. Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Warp advantage (p. 97). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary – one per ability – and it is possible for one to succeed while the other fails, or for both to fail. +10%.  Special Limitations Cannot Escort: This is only available for world-jumpers. Other Jumpers cannot 'hitch a ride,' even if you want to bring them along. -10%. Cannot Follow: This is only available for world-jumpers. You cannot 'hitch a ride' with another Jumper. -20%. Drift: You do not arrive in exactly the location you left from. You won't arrive in thin air or underground, but you may show up anywhere within 10 miles of your planned destination. The better your IQ roll when you jump, the closer you will be to where you wanted to arrive, but it's the GM's call as to exactly where you appear. -15%. Limited Jump: You can only travel a certain distance through time, or a certain number of 'removes' between parallel worlds, per jump. To go further, you must make multiple hops. The GM must set the value of this limitation for his campaign; it will be more of a handicap in some settings than in others. A suggested value is -10%.  Maximum Range: You can only jump a certain total distance through time, or a certain number of 'removes' between parallel worlds, no matter how many hops you make. Like Limited Jump, the GM must set the value of this limitation. Naked: You can carry nothing when you jump! You always arrive naked. -30%.

The point cost depends on how sweeping the immunity is (GM's judgment): • You are not subject to ordinary laws, but the rules that govern your behavior are just as strict. Examples: a medieval abbot or a modern UN observer. 5 points. • As above, but the laws that apply to you are less strict than those that apply to most people.

Anyone who violates your immunity risks damage to his name and reputation. Other bards will compose and distribute vicious satires about him, giving him a bad Reputation. They might even expose a Secret, if he has one! This advantage applies to the content of your performances and nothing else. It is only available to true bards, in fantasy/medieval settings. To qualify for this advantage, you must spend at least 1 point apiece on the Performance, Poetry, and Singing skills. 10 points. Diplomatic Immunity: You are an international diplomat. You may ignore the laws of all countries except your own. While abroad, you cannot be prosecuted for any crime, no matter how grave; the local police may arrest you, but they cannot press charges. The only recourse for a foreign government is to declare you persona non grata. This means you must leave the country at once, ending your current assignment – and possibly your career.

Magery 0: This is basic 'magical awareness,' a prerequisite for learning magic in most worlds. The GM makes a Sense roll (p. 358) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll! 5 points. Magery 1+: Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn spells as if you had IQ 17. Add your Magery level to Perception when you roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn Thaumatology skill (p. 225). Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost) by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4. For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time. Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be sure to skim the Spell List (pp. 242253) when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells; see Magery and Effect (p. 237). The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to PCs. Magery 3 is about right for 'classic fantasy.' 10 points/level (on top of the 5 points for Magery 0).  Mages in Nonmagical Settings The use of Magery becomes tricky in nonmagical backgrounds. You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, 'That idol is magical,' but, 'That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it.' If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting. Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the  limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as 'aspected Magery.'  Special Limitations Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%. Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. -50%. Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky – on average, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun's position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%.  when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%. One College Only: Your Magery only benefits the spells of a single college and the Recover Energy spell (p. 248). You learn other spells as though you were a nonmage, and can only cast them in high-mana areas. You may still count such spells as prerequisites for spells in your own college. You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%. Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you – but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won't notice if someone else approaches. -40%. Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells.

If you win, your victim will obey your every command until you free him. In effect, he temporarily gains the Reprogrammable disadvantage (p. 150), with you as his master. Your control persists for as long as you take uninterrupted Concentrate maneuvers. Once you stop, your control lingers for one minute per point by which you won the Quick Contest.

If you are incapacitated (stunned, knocked out, etc.), or attempt to force the subject to act against his principles (e.g., commit suicide or harm a loved one), roll  another Quick Contest. If your victim wins, he breaks free. Roll at the moment of truth – you can march him to the edge of a cliff, but he doesn't roll until he's about to leap. If you lose, you cannot attempt to control that subject again for 24 hours, and he feels a sense of mental coercion emanating from you. On a critical failure, you also lose control of anyone else under the influence of this ability! Mind Control often has limitations: Accessibility (Only on opposite sex), Sense-Based (for hypnotic voices, eyes, scents, etc.), and so on.

Mindlink does not allow automatic contact across interstellar distances (more than 0.1 light-year), nor can it reach other dimensions, parallel worlds, etc. Mindlink costs 5 points for a single person, 10 points for 2-9 people, 20 points for 10-99 people, 30 points for 100-999 people, and so on – add 10 points per tenfold increase in the number of people.   As a rule, the GM should only permit PCs to buy Mindlinks with Allies, Contacts, and Dependents; duplicates (see Duplication, p. 50); and other PCs (if their players permit).  Special Modifiers You may give Mindlink the same modifiers as your Mind Reading or Telesend advantage. In most cases, the GM should require this.  Modular Abilities Mental or Physical; Exotic Variable  You have a pool of character points that you can reallocate under certain conditions. You may rearrange these points to add a skill (spell, technique, etc.) or mental advantage temporarily – or to improve such a trait, if you already have it. When you do, you lose any abilities to which those points were previously assigned. This advantage comes in 'slots.' A slot can hold one skill or mental advantage at a time. Each slot has a fixed base cost, plus a cost per point in the pool for that slot. Both costs depend on the type of Modular Abilities you have. Computer Brain: Your abilities are actually computer programs. The GM decides whether a program exists for a given ability. If you have Telecommunication (p. 91), you may download programs, usually from a network. How long this takes depends on the speed of data transfer in the setting – a second per character point works well. In some worlds, you must pay for such programs; $100 per character point is typical. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities. Chip Slots: As above, but the programs come on physical chips that you must plug into a socket – usually in your skull. It takes three seconds to insert or remove a chip. Chips typically have negligible weight, but cost $100 to $1,000 per point of abilities. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. Super-Memorization: You gain new abilities through rapid study. This takes a second per character point. You can 'forget' a memorized ability instantly. You can only memorize abilities if you have a suitable reference work (book, film, tape, etc.). The GM  determines the cash cost of such works. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. Cosmic Power: You simply wish new abilities into being. This takes one second per ability. Unlike other Modular Abilities, you only ever have one 'slot,' and can rearrange your points into as many or as few abilities as you wish, to the limit of your advantage. 10 points per point of abilities. Example: Alex buys two Chip Slots at a base cost of 5 points/slot. This costs 10 points. One slot can hold a chip with a single ability worth up to 2 points, and costs 6 points. The other can hold up to 5 points, and costs 15 points. Total cost is 31 points. This appears on Alex's character sheet as 'Chip Slots 2 (2, 5).' Alex will have to buy, borrow, or steal the chips he uses – but he need not pay character points for them. Use Preparation Required (p. 114) to increase the time needed to rearrange your points, and Limited Use (p. 112) to represent an ability that you forget immediately after using it.  Special Enhancements  Physical: Your ability is not limited to skills and mental advantages. +50% for physical advantages only, or +100% for any mental or physical ability.  Special Limitations Spells Only: Your ability only works with magic spells, which must usually be 'memorized' from a grimoire. This is mutually exclusive with Physical. -20%.

Add the Area Effect enhancement (p. 102) to increase this radius. The affected sense is at -1 per level of Obscure to detect anything within your radius. Ten levels will block the sense completely. The boundaries of the zone are easily detected by the affected sense, however; roll at +1 per level.  Special Enhancements Defensive: You are unaffected by your own Obscure ability. +50%.

Once per day, you may check the omens. This normally  requires at least an hour, but if the GM has something in particular he wants to communicate, he may arbitrarily put it in your path. The GM rolls twice, in secret, when you use this ability: once to determine whether you discover the omen, once to see if you interpret it correctly. Discovery: To detect an omen requires a Sense roll. On a success, you discover the omen; on a critical success, you get +5 on the subsequent interpretation roll. On a failure, you find nothing of oracular significance. On a critical failure, the GM lies – he tells you that you have found an omen, but this is, in reality, a product of your own fears or wishes.  Interpretation: To interpret an omen requires an IQ roll. On a success, the omen is very general; e.g., 'an enemy approaches' or 'a great power, long dormant, is stirring.' On a critical success, the information is more specific: 'you risk the wrath of the king,' 'seek out the mage in the tower,' etc. On a failure, the omen is simply too vague to be useful.

  "advantage-patrons-description": "A 'Patron' is an NPC – or even an entire organization – that serves as your advisor, employer, mentor, or protector. An employer must be exceptional to qualify as a Patron, though; a Patron is much more than an ordinary boss!  Power The base point cost of a Patron depends on its power. Use the categories below as a guide, but note that some Patrons won't fit neatly into any of them. The GM's word is final.   A powerful individual (usually built on at least 150% of the PC's starting points) or a fairly powerful organization (assets of at least 1,000 times starting wealth for the world). 10 points. An extremely powerful individual (built on at least twice the PC's starting points) or a powerful organization (assets of at least 10,000 times starting wealth). Examples: a limited manifestation of a minor god, a billionaire, or a big-city police department. 15 points. An ultra-powerful individual (built on as many points as the GM wants!) or a very powerful organization (assets of at least 100,000 times starting wealth). Examples: a super, a limited manifestation of a major god, or a big city. 20 points. An extremely powerful organization (assets of at least 1 million times starting wealth). Examples: a large corporation or a very small nation. 25 points. A national government or giant multinational organization (net worth basically incalculable), or a true god who appears personally to intervene on your behalf. 30 points.  Note that the base cost to have a deity as a Patron is comparable to that for a powerful mundane Patron, but divine power requires the Special Abilities enhancement (see below), which will greatly increase the final cost of a divine Patron!  Frequency of Appearance Choose a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36). If the GM determines that your Patron appears at the start of an adventure, he may design the adventure to include an assignment or aid from the Patron. He may also choose to leave out your Patron, if its appearance would make no sense or disrupt the adventure. However, if the GM determined that your Patron could have appeared, and you try to contact your Patron during the adventure (for help, advice, etc.), then the contact is likely to be successful and you may receive aid. (Within reason – if you're locked in a dungeon without any means of communication, you won't be contacting anybody.) You will not know whether your Patron is 'available' on a given adventure until you attempt to request aid. As a rule, you should only be able to reach your Patron for help once per adventure. Remember that a powerful Patron could be helpful without actually intervening! A Chicago hood who can say, 'I'm from Big Eddie,' or a crimefighter who can flash a Q-clearance card, may carry some extra weight in a tough spot.  Party Patrons Often, several PCs – perhaps the entire party – share a Patron (they are all agents of the same government, servants of the same cult, etc.). No matter how many characters share a Patron, the cost is not shared; each character must pay full price for the Patron. On the other hand, the GM will make an appearance roll for each character at the start of each adventure – and if the Patron appears for any of them, then it is usually available for all of them. The GM should scale the quality and quantity of the aid provided in proportion to the number of successful appearance rolls.  Drawbacks of Patrons If your Patron is an army, corporation, feudal lord, etc., you may owe it a Duty (p. 133). A god or similar Patron may require a stringent code of behavior in return for its aid; see SelfImposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). A Patron might also have powerful foes that are now your foes; this can give you an Enemy (p. 135). Such factors can cut the effective cost of a Patron significantly, and turn it from a benefit to a considerable liability!  Employers and Patrons Not every employer is a Patron. If you can depend on your employer to get you out of trouble (at least sometimes), it might really be a Patron. Otherwise, it's just a job. For example, a small police department is a 10point Patron if, as most do, it takes care of its own. But the U.S. Army, though powerful, is not a likely Patron – at least for an ordinary trooper. You could say, 'The Colonel takes care of his men.' But you could just as easily say, 'I'm on my own if I get in trouble,' and play a soldier who does not have a Patron.  Examples of Patrons • A powerful wizard as Patron to warriors (or young wizards) whom he sends to find magical items or slay foes. • A crime lord as Patron to freelance thieves or assassins. • A minor deity as Patron to a traveling Righter of Wrongs. • A local police department as Patron to a private detective. (They might find him annoying at times, but he helps them out, and vice versa.) • A local ruler (in any world) as Patron to an adventurer. • A large company as Patron to a troubleshooter or spy. • A super-crimefighter or politician as Patron to a news reporter. • Any intelligence organization as occasional Patron to a freelance operative, or full-time Patron to its own agents. (The difference between this and ordinary jobs is that you can't quit ...) You can apply the following modifiers after multiplying for frequency of appearance.  Special Enhancements Equipment: Your Patron supplies useful equipment that you can use for  your own purposes, and that you would otherwise have to buy. This enhancement only applies if the equipment is yours once given. A soldier with a military Patron would not pay extra for his weapons, since when he goes off duty, he can't take them along. An adventurer in the employ of a generous noble who hands out useful 'gifts' would pay extra. +50% if the equipment is worth no more than the average starting wealth in the campaign, or +100% if it is worth more than that. Highly Accessible: You can attempt to contact your Patron at any time – even when you are locked in a dungeon, lost in the desert, etc. This is most appropriate if your Patron is a spirit, a god you can petition via prayer, etc. +50%. Special Abilities: Your Patron wields power out of proportion to its wealth or point value. +50% if your Patron has extensive social or political power (e.g., the Governor of New York or the Pope), or +100% if your Patron has magical powers in a nonmagical world, possesses equipment from a TL greater than yours, grants you special powers, or has unusual reach in time or space (e.g., a super, spirit, or god).  Special Limitations Minimal Intervention: Your Patron is less useful than its power level would suggest. On a successful appearance roll, the GM makes a reaction roll for your Patron to determine whether it actually provides aid; see Requests for Aid (p. 562). On a Neutral or better reaction, you receive the aid your Patron thinks you need – which may or may not be what you want. This is the classic modifier for gods who have many other minions to aid, and frequently accompanies the Pact limitation (see p. 113). -50%. Secret: Your Patron works behind the scenes. You do not know who it is and you cannot request aid directly. You might be able to call for help in such a way that the Patron gets the message (GM's decision), but there is no guarantee that the Patron will take action. The only evidence of this kind of Patron is minor incidents and 'lucky breaks.' This may take the form of information, equipment, or even direct aid ... but only when it suits the Patron, and always in an untraceable way. A Patron like this often regards its  aid as an investment on which it expects some return; therefore, it might not have your best interests at heart! Only the GM knows any of these details. You know nothing other than the fact that you have a Patron. -50%. Unwilling: You obtained your Patron through coercion (e.g., blackmail). It provides aid only because there is no other choice, and it definitely does not have your best interests at heart! You will eventually make one request too many (GM's judgment – perhaps if the appearance roll comes up 18) and lose the Patron: remove the Patron from your character sheet and lower your point value accordingly. Since a Patron is by definition more powerful than you are, taking an Unwilling Patron is risky. If the Patron can find a way to break your 'hold,' it will, and may well become an Enemy! -50%.",

Those without Injury Tolerance (Homogenous) (p. 60) or the Machine meta-trait (p. 263) should ask the GM's permission before taking more than five levels of Payload. You must allocate your Payload between cargo and occupants when you buy the advantage: Cargo: 20 lbs. of cargo space is roughly equal to one cubic foot of capacity. A typical car has about 10-20 cubic feet of storage space; a semitrailer has about 2,400 cf. Occupants: A human-sized being requires about 200 lbs. of capacity. For others, take average racial weight and increase it by 1/3. An actual cabin requires 10 times that weight. Your defensive advantages (DR, Sealed, etc.) also protect your occupants.

Special Limitations Treat your Payload as part of your body, not as encumbrance or carried weight, when calculating Move and using advantages with limited carrying capacity, such as Invisibility, Jumper, and Warp. Machines that can push or pull large external loads – or pick them up and carry them with arms, cranes, etc. – have Lifting ST (p. 65), not Payload.

Common substances, such as plastic, stone, or wood, are -30%; less common materials, such as brick or asphalt, are -20%; one specific material, such as lead, is -10%. Specific: Your ability only works through one particular substance.

  "advantage-peripheral-vision-description": "You have an unusually wide field of vision. You can see a 180° arc in front of you without turning your head, and have 30° of peripheral vision to either side of that. This gives you a 240° 'arc of vision' for observation and ranged attacks. The figure above shows the arc of vision for a normal character (white) and for someone with Peripheral Vision (gray plus white). If you are playing with a battle map, you can make melee attacks into 'side' ('right' and 'left') hexes as well as 'front' hexes – although a onehanded attack to the opposite side (e.g., attacking your left hex with your right hand) is clumsy and considered a Wild Swing (see p. 388). You still cannot attack a foe directly behind you except with a Wild Swing. This also helps on defense! If you are attacked from a 'side' hex, you defend at no penalty. Even against attacks from the rear, your active defense is only at -2. Out of combat, you get +3 to all rolls to detect Shadowing attempts or ambushes from behind, and the GM will always make a Vision roll for you to spot dangers 'behind your back.'  Special Limitations Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.",

  "advantage-permeation-description": "You can move through a particular solid material as if it didn't exist. You do not open a passage behind you; observers just see you 'melt' into the surface and disappear. You need Penetrating Vision (p. 74) to see where you're going. You must still breathe (unless you have Doesn't Breathe), which limits trips to the length of time you can hold your breath (see Holding Your Breath, p. 351). Permeation differs from Insubstantiality. You are affected by gravity, and you are limited to normal movement; if you lack Flight or another movement advantage, you must walk at your Basic Move. Furthermore, you can be affected by any attack that can reach you within a solid object. You also remain vulnerable to attacks with the material you can pass through, unless you purchase Damage Resistance to such attacks. Cost depends on how often you are likely to encounter the material you can permeate in the form of a barrier. For instance, paper might be a  'Common' substance, but since walls of paper are uncommon, it is treated as 'Rare' for the purpose of Permeation. Very Common: Earth (including clay, mud, and sand), metal, stone (including brick, concrete, and plaster), wood, and other ubiquitous structural materials. 40 points. Common: Concrete, plastic, steel, and other specific, common structural materials. 20 points. Occasional: Glass, ice (including snow), sand, and anything else that a normal person could eventually break or tunnel through using muscle power, as well as somewhat unusual structural materials, such as aluminum and copper. 10 points. Rare: Bone, flesh, paper, and other materials rarely encountered in large quantities or as barriers. 5 points.  Special Enhancements Can Carry Objects: Normally, you cannot carry anything while moving through matter. This enhancement lets you carry objects, including clothing and armor. If dropped, they 'pop' into open space at the point where you entered the material. You cannot leave things inside solid matter! No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%. Tunnel: You can leave a tunnel (of about your size) behind you, if you choose. This rearranges the object you are moving though without inflicting damage, and does not work at all on living targets. For an ability that can rip holes in objects and people, see Innate Attack (p. 61). +40%.",

Furthermore, this advantage functions as Empathy (p. 51) with respect to sentient plants, and allows you to  use your Influence skills (see p. 359) on such entities, which will usually ensure a positive reaction. This ability frequently accompanies some level of Green Thumb (see Talent, p. 89) and often Sense of Duty (Plants) or Vow (Use plant material only if gathered without severe injury to the plant).",

  "advantage-possession-type": "Mental; Exotic",
  "advantage-possession-description": "You can move your consciousness from body to body. In theory, you could live forever this way, moving from dying bodies to healthy ones. However, you cannot survive outside a living host. Should your current body die, you will die! Thus, you must keep your current host alive ... at least until you can find a replacement. To possess a new host, you must concentrate for one second and physically touch him. Attempts to possess your own Puppet (p. 78) succeed automatically. In all other cases, roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. the subject's Will. Your victim resists at +5 if he is in combat with you or otherwise wary of you, so it is best to be subtle. If you lose or tie, you are mentally stunned for 1d seconds. In addition, you may never attempt to possess that subject again – he is 'immune' to you. If you win, you take over your victim's body, completely suppressing his personality. Your previous host regains control of his body (if sentient) after 1d seconds of mental stun, and 'comes to' with no memory of the possession. You gain your new host's ST, DX, and HT (and secondary characteristics calculated from these scores), as well as his physical advantages and disadvantages. You keep your own IQ, Perception, and Will, and all of your mental traits. Your social traits may apply, depending on the laws and values of your society. Skills are a special case. Your IQ-, Perception-, and Will-based skills are unchanged. Other skills remain at the same relative skill level. For instance, if you have Acrobatics at DX+3, then you would have Acrobatics-12 in a DX 9 body and Acrobatics-14 in a DX 11 body.  If you occupy a sentient host, you have sufficient access to his memories for the first few hours of the takeover to learn his name and daily routine, but not enough to learn IQ-based skills. To recall a specific fact from the host's memories, you must roll vs. IQ, at -1 per hour since the takeover. Only one attempt is allowed for any given memory!  Telecontrol: You remotely control your new host as if he were a puppet, leaving your original body in a trance. You may choose to return to your body at any time, and must do so if your host falls unconscious or dies (but not if he sleeps). As a result, you do not die if your host dies. +50%.  Precognition: You cannot control the content of these flashes – you just know that something interesting or important might happen, at some unspecified future date. If you occupy a host for a long time, or hop between multiple bodies, the GM is free to adjust your point value to reflect the most expensive body you regularly occupy. For more on this subject, see Chapter 9. With suitable modifiers, Possession can represent diverse abilities seen in speculative fiction. Note that the Digital, Magical, Parasitic, Spiritual, and Telepathic limitations are mutually exclusive.  Special Enhancements Assimilation: When you enter a new body, you may choose to 'forget' any of your current skills and use the points this frees up – and any unspent points – to learn ST-, DX-, or HT-based skills known by the host, at up to (host's level)-1. For instance, if you do not know Acrobatics, but your host knows it at DX+3, you can pick it up at DX+2 ... if you have enough points. Skills forgotten in order to learn new skills are gone. Skills learned from your host will move from body to body with you. +10%. Chronic: When you exit a host, you can leave a 'back door' that lets you possess him again without a Quick Contest. This lets you buy your former host as a Puppet. You can only use this enhancement if you have enough unspent points to buy a Puppet at the time you leave your host. +20%. Mind Swap: Your host's mind moves into your previous body instead of being suppressed – in effect, you 'trade places.' +10%.  Special Limitations Digital: This limitation is only available to Digital Minds (p. 48). You take over computers, not living bodies. The target system must be connected to your current host computer via a network, and you must have complete access to it – voluntary or otherwise (see Computer Hacking, p. 184). The target computer's hardware must be complex enough to run your computer program; in general, its Complexity must be at least half your IQ (round up). You can also take over a computer using a copy of yourself while leaving the original intact! However, unless you have the Digital version of Duplication (p. 50), any system you take over this way becomes an independent NPC that thinks it is you. This can be good or bad – the duplicate could become any type of Associated NPC (see p. 31). -40%. Magical: Your advantage is an innate magic talent. If the subject is protected by a spell that repels hostile magic, you must win a Quick Contest of your IQ vs. that spell before you can make a possession attempt. If your victim has Magic Resistance, it subtracts from your IQ and adds to his Will during the actual possession attempt. -10%. Mindlink Required: You can only possess someone with whom you have a Mindlink. If the link is ever jammed, out of range, etc., the possession ends. If the Mindlink has the Telecommunication limitation, Mindlink Required can represent control via an  implant, telepresence, or similar technology. -40%. No Memory Access: You have no access to your host's memories. -10%. Parasitic: You enter your host's body physically. You must have Permeation (Flesh) (p. 75) to do this, unless your host has sufficient Payload (p. 74) to contain you – and your victim must have a higher Size Modifier than you. After entering your victim's body, you may attempt to possess him. He resists with the higher of HT or Will. You aren't forced out if you lose, but he is 'immune' to you, so you need to find another host soon. While you are in someone else's body, he (if he is still uncontrolled) or his friends might be able to use technological means to detect you – and possibly remove you. Attacks that penetrate or ignore your host's DR can injure you, but his HP act as extra DR for this purpose. If you are microbial, you should purchase Injury Tolerance (Diffuse) (p. 60), which will protect you. The host nourishes you, and may have to eat extra food as a result. You can choose to leave at any time, the same way you entered. You may also temporarily release your host while continuing occupation. If you do, you will have to win a new Quick Contest to regain control. -60%. Puppet Only: You may possess your own Puppets automatically, but you cannot possess anyone else. -30%. Spiritual: You must have the Spirit meta-trait (p. 263) to take this limitation. Your spirit body merges with and occupies the body of your host. It remains insubstantial during the possession, traveling inside the host but otherwise inaccessible to you and effectively mindless. It can be injured as detailed under Parasitic, but only by attacks that affect insubstantial things. A genuine exorcist can cast you out by winning a Quick Contest of his exorcism ability vs. your Will. You cannot return to a body you have been cast out of for at least 24 hours. You may choose to release your host at any time. If you are exorcised or leave voluntarily, the host recovers after 1d seconds of mental stun. -20%. Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.",

  "advantage-power-investiture-type": "Mental; Supernatural",
  "advantage-power-investiture-description": "A deity – god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. – has empowered you to cast 'clerical' spells. Add your Power Investiture to your IQ when you learn spells granted by the deity who bestowed this advantage. For instance, IQ 12 and Power Investiture 2 (Thor) would let you learn spells granted by the god Thor (and only Thor) as if you had IQ 14. You may only learn clerical spells from a fixed list set by your deity, who may even dictate which specific spells you learn. The GM determines this list and takes on the role of your deity when you wish to learn new spells. However, because you are channeling divine will as opposed to studying magic, clerical spells do not have prerequisites. In general, the more Power Investiture you have, the 'holier' you are. The maximum level of Power Investiture depends on your deity, as determined by the GM. Minor deities who have a limited ability to transfer power to their chosen, or a small range of possible spell effects, might grant only one level, while major deities might be more generous. Note that Power Investiture is a measure of your bond with your deity, while Clerical Investment (p. 43) and Religious Rank (p. 30) measure social power. These need not be related. Power Investiture might be restricted to high-ranking clerics ... but a deity can grant power to anyone it wants (possibly to the chagrin of the church!). In some cases, you can add or increase Power Investiture in play. What this entails depends on the deity. To gain, keep, or improve Power Investiture, you nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). If you break these vows, you will lose some or all of your powers – perhaps until you have made proper penance, perhaps permanently. In effect, Power Investiture comes with a built-in Pact limitation (see p. 113); do not apply this modifier again. You may also need to meet certain physical requirements. Some deities only empower men, women, eunuchs, virgins ... the GM should be creative. Should you lose a special requirement (such as virginity), your Power Investiture may be diminished or lost, reducing your point value accordingly. You can have both Magery and Power Investiture (unless your deity forbids this), but Magery does not improve clerical spells and Power Investiture does not aid magical spells. The clerical and magical versions of a given spell are entirely different spells, and clerical spells never count as prerequisites for magical spells. If you know both versions of a spell, they do not affect one another. Power Investiture is one possible way to handle 'holy powers.' It is most appropriate in settings where priests are divinely inspired wizards. For other views of divine gifts, see Blessed (p. 40) and True Faith (p. 94).",

  "advantage-precognition-description": "You receive glimpses of future events. You cannot control the content of these flashes – you just know that something interesting or important might happen, at some unspecified future date. You might learn this through visions, voices, or 'sudden knowledge.' A vivid premonition of a terrible event might even require a Fright Check (p. 360)! Precognition only gives information that your 'future self' could learn and that would matter to you. For instance, if you're in New York, you are unlikely to have a premonition about a random murder in Los Angeles. But if the victim was a friend, or if the killing was important enough to make national news, you might 'flash' on it. Nothing about the future is certain, though. Even if the GM has made up his mind, he could reconsider ... although something related to the premonition should still happen. In most settings, predicted events will occur unless you take specific action to prevent them. (But the GM is free to rule that the future is immutable in his setting!) Whenever the GM feels a premonition would be appropriate, he will secretly make an IQ roll for you – usually during an encounter with a person or object. For instance, meeting someone with an important event in his future might set off a premonition related to that event, especially if it would affect you in some way. Similarly, seeing a picture of a place could set off a vision involving that location. A deliberate attempt to use Precognition requires 10 minutes of concentration, 2 FP, and an IQ roll at -8. You can attempt to read your own future, or that of another person. To deliberately read the future of someone else, you must be able to touch him. Precognition is normally limited to 'seeing' into the near future – perhaps a week or so. At the GM's option, however, a critical success or a very important event might result in visions from much further in the future. Note that Precognition includes Danger Sense (p. 47) – do not take both.  Special Limitations  Can't See Own Death: Your Precognition cannot detect people or events that the GM believes have a high probability of causing your death. Your ability does not include Danger Sense. -60%. ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%.

A native pressure other than 1 atmosphere is a 0-point feature, but if you can survive for a prolonged period of time at a wide range of pressures, you have an advantage. This trait comes in three levels: Pressure Support 1: You can survive at pressures between your native pressure and 10 times that. (This would enable a human to survive on most of Earth's continental shelves.) 5 points. Pressure Support 2: You can withstand pressures between your native pressure and 100 times that. (This would enable a human to survive anywhere in Earth's oceans, save the deepest trenches.) 10 points. Pressure Support 3: You are immune to the effects of high pressure. 15 points. Pressure Support lets your body stay at a constant internal pressure with respect to a constant and uniform external pressure. This protects against attacks that manipulate ambient pressure or crush the entire body, but provides no defense against localized or transient pressure changes. In particular, Pressure Support does not reduce or prevent damage from crushing attacks or explosions of any kind.

  "advantage-resistant-type": "Physical",
  "advantage-resistant-description": "You are naturally resistant (or even immune) to noxious items or substances that are not direct, physical attacks. This gives you a bonus on all HT rolls to resist incapacitation or injury from such things. The bonus from Resistant applies to all rolls to resist noxious effects within a particular category – usually some combination of disease, poison, and environmental syndromes (altitude sickness, the bends, space sickness, etc.). It also applies to rolls to resist attacks that use these effects. This includes Afflictions with one of Blood Agent, Contact Agent, FollowUp, or Respiratory Agent, and Innate Attacks that have such modifiers and inflict toxic or fatigue damage. Resistant does not protect against effects that Damage Resistance or Protected Sense either stop or provide a HT bonus to resist. This includes Afflictions and Innate Attacks that do not have any of the modifiers given above. The base cost for Resistant depends on the rarity of the effects it counteracts:  Very Common: A broad category within the noxious items described above. Example: Metabolic Hazards (all threats that only affect the living, including all disease and poison, plus such syndromes as altitude sickness, bends, seasickness, and jet lag). 30 points. Common: A group of related items encountered as often in nature as in an attack, or some other suitably broad subset of 'Very Common.' Example: Poison (all toxins, but not asphyxiants or corrosives) or Sickness (all diseases and environmental syndromes). 15 points. Occasional: A group of closely related items more often encountered in nature than as a deliberate attack, or a subset of a 'Common' group. Examples: Disease (all bacteria, viruses, fungus infections, etc.) or Ingested Poison. 10 points. Rare: A specific item or environmental syndrome, or a subset of an 'Occasional' group. Examples: Acceleration (blackouts due to extreme G-forces), Altitude Sickness, Bends (decompression sickness), Seasickness, or Space Sickness; Nanomachines. 5 points. Multiply base cost to reflect your degree of resistance: You are totally immune to all noxious effects, and never have to make resistance rolls (write this as 'Immunity' on your character sheet): x1. You have +8 to all HT rolls to resist: x1/2. You have +3 to all HT rolls to resist: x1/3. Drop all fractions from the final cost. An ordinary human could believably have any level of resistance to a mundane 'Rare' item, such as Seasickness. He might also have Resistant to Disease (+3) [3], Resistant to Disease (+8) [5], or Resistant to   Poison (+3) [5]. Anything more would be superhuman. Golems, robots, undead, and other beings that are not truly 'alive' must take Immunity to Metabolic Hazards [30]; this is already included in the Machine meta-trait (p. 263). When in doubt, the GM's word is final. Mental Resistance: It is possible to be Resistant to a purely mental threat. This works as described above, except that the bonus applies to resistance rolls against IQ and Will instead of HT. 'Psionics' is an allowed category, and is considered Very Common.",

  "advantage-scanning-sense-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "advantage-scanning-sense-description": "You can emit energy, bounce it off objects, and analyze the returned signal to build up a 'picture' of your surroundings. This lets you discern size and shape, but not color or fine detail (such as writing). It has nothing to do with the normal human sense of sight, and requires no light. As a result, you may ignore darkness penalties in combat. Perception is limited to a 120° arc in front of you. Your sense is 'active.' Anyone who can sense the signal you emit can detect you, out to twice your own range. Unlike other sensory advantages, however, you can turn this ability off; see Turning Advantages Off and On (p. 34). Below are several varieties of Scanning Sense. Each is a separate advantage, with its own special rules. Where these rules contradict the general ones given above, follow the special rules. Each sense also has a base range. To adjust this, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses radio waves. Base range is 2,000 yards. You can only detect large (humansized or larger), dense objects. On a Sense roll, you get a general idea of the relative size of the object, and whether it is moving, but nothing more precise. You cannot get an actual 'image' with Radar, or use it to aim attacks. Radar works best on flying targets; roll at -4 to spot anyone who is not silhouetted against the sky. Radar does not work at all underwater. 20 points. Imaging Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses millimeter-wave radar. Base range is 200 yards. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Imaging Radar can see through thin fabric or vegetation. You get +3 to locate objects like concealed weapons, and may ignore penalties for spotting objects hidden behind light brush. Ordinary radar detectors detect Imaging Radar at -4. Imaging Radar does not work underwater. 20 points. Ladar: Your Scanning Sense uses a laser beam. Base range is 200 yards. Ladar is very similar to Imaging Radar, but the beam is narrower and offers better resolution. This gives -4 on rolls to locate objects of interest, but +4 on rolls to identify them. Only specialized ladar detectors can detect Ladar, and at -4 even then. Ladar cannot penetrate dense smoke or solid objects. It has 10-50% range in falling rain or snow, and 1% range underwater. 20 points. Para-Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses energy unknown to 21st-century science. Treat Para-Radar as Imaging Radar, except that it functions in any environment! Ordinary radar detectors cannot detect Para-Radar, although some ultra-tech sensors might be able to do so. 40 points. Sonar: Your Scanning Sense uses ultrasonic sound waves. Base range is 2,000 yards underwater. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Sonar does not function if you are deafened, and can be 'jammed' or fooled by a very loud noise (e.g., an explosion). Individuals with Ultrahearing can detect Sonar. Sonar is much less effective in air: range is only 20 yards multiplied by air pressure in atmospheres (one atmosphere on Earth). Sonar is completely ineffective in vacuum. 20 points.  Special Enhancements Extended Arc: You can scan an arc greater than 120°. A 240° arc (as described for Peripheral Vision, p. 74) is +75%; a 360° arc (as described for 360° Vision, p. 34) is +125%. Low-Probability Intercept (LPI): This is only available for Radar and Sonar. You can switch this enhancement on and off. Turning it on makes your signal difficult to detect. This halves range, but your Scanning Sense can only be detected at 1.5 times the halved range. +10%. Multi-Mode: This is only available for Radar. You can switch between Radar and Imaging Radar. (This is much cheaper than buying the two advantages separately, because they overlap to some extent.) +50%. Penetrating: This is only available for Para-Radar. You can 'see' inside any object within range. This functions exactly as Penetrating Vision 2 (p. 74). +50%. Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can 'lock onto' any object within range and determine its precise range and speed – just as if you had a high-tech rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%.  Special Limitations Targeting Only: As Targeting, but you can only use your sense to 'lock onto' targets already spotted with another sense; you cannot use it to spot things. -40%.",

  "advantage-shadow-form-description": "You can become a two-dimensional shadow. This lets you slip along walls and floors – and through the thinnest cracks (anything wide enough to fit your shoulders through) – at your usual ground Move. You can also defy gravity, creeping up walls and across ceilings at half Move. Physical attacks do half damage to you in this form. Energy attacks do normal damage, except for light-based attacks, which do 50% extra damage. Magic, psi, and other purely mental abilities affect you normally. You are subject to a few major restrictions while in this form. You cannot walk through three-dimensional space; you must slide along an object. Furthermore, you cannot perform any purely physical attacks or actions, and you cannot carry ordinary items or affect them in any way. You can use magic, psi, and similar abilities, however. If you cannot switch out of Shadow Form, Shadow Form is a disadvantage worth -20 points. This will make it difficult to interact with others! You may still add enhancements, but they will work like limitations, reducing the value of the disadvantage. For instance, a +50% enhancement would reduce the value of the disadvantage by 50%, to -10 points.  Special Enhancements Can Carry Objects: You may carry objects.

For instance, if you suffer 10 HP of damage and a broken leg in a form that has 20 HP, you will have 5 HP of damage and a broken leg when you switch to a form that has only 10 HP. If you are knocked out or killed, you immediately revert to your native form (which will also be unconscious or dead). In addition, you must specify a single, reasonably common external influence that can force you to return to your native form against your will. This should suit the advantage's origin: a Dispel Magic spell if your ability is magical, exorcism if a spirit power, strong magnetic fields if technological, etc. Shapeshifting comprises two different traits: Alternate Form and Morph.",
  "advantage-shapeshifting-cost": "Variable",
  "advantage-alternate-form": "Alternate Form",
  "advantage-alternate-form-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "advantage-alternate-form-description": "Like the werewolf of folklore, you can assume a specific form other than your own. This can be anything built with points: humanoid, animal, robot, etc. Create your alternate form as a racial template (p. 260); however, you can switch it 'on' and 'off.' This template need not be a 'stock' template. For instance, if you wish to retain human intelligence in beast form, you could shift into a template that lacks the beast's low IQ (although this increases the template cost and hence the cost of Alternate Form). The GM is the final judge of what templates are allowed as Alternate Forms. While it is turned on, your Alternate Form's racial template replaces your native racial template. Apply its racial traits – attribute modifiers, racial advantages and disadvantages, etc. – instead of those of your native race. Personal traits (including all attribute levels, advantages, disadvantages, and skills bought over and above racial norms) remain intact, although your skill levels are affected by changes to the controlling attribute scores.  If the Alternate Form's racial template has traits that conflict with your personal traits, the traits of your Alternate Form take precedence. For instance, if you become a dolphin with No Manipulators, you will temporarily lose personal advantages that affect your hands, such as High Manual Dexterity, while you are in dolphin form – and some skills (for instance, Lockpicking) will be relatively useless, although you do remember them. If you have a single Alternate Form, it costs 15 points for a racial template worth no more than your native racial template. A more powerful form costs 15 points plus 90% of the difference in cost between your native template and that of your Alternate Form. If you have multiple forms, pay full cost for the most expensive form. The less powerful Alternate Forms cost a flat 15 points apiece. Minimum cost per form is still 15 points. Example: Consider four racial templates: a -100-point 'cuddly critter,' a 0-point human, an 80-point 'ravenous beast,' and a 100-point troll. A human who can turn into a cuddly critter pays 15 points, as the cuddly critter template is worth less than his native template. A cuddly critter who can turn into a human pays 15 + (0.9 x 100) = 105 points, since the human racial template is worth 100 points more than his own. A human who can become a troll also pays 15 + (0.9 x 100) = 105 points. A human who can assume any of the other three templates would pay full cost for his most expensive form, the troll: 105 points. The ravenous beast and cuddly critter forms would cost the minimum 15 points apiece. Total cost would be 135 points. Were-Creatures: To create the classic 'were-creature,' start by purchasing any trait that applies in both forms – Infectious Attack, Vulnerability (Silver), etc. – as a personal trait. Next, buy an animal template as an Alternate Form. Since most beast templates are worth 0 or fewer points, this will usually cost 15 points, but powerful creatures (e.g., bears and tigers) may cost more. If the beast form is savage, the template should include such traits as Berserk, Bestial, and Bloodlust. Finally, apply limitations  such as Emergencies Only (p. 112), Unconscious Only (p. 115), and Uncontrollable (p. 116) to Alternate Form, as applicable. If you can only change during the full moon, add a -40% Trigger limitation (p. 115) as well. Shapeshifting Races: When creating an entire race that has Alternate Form, work out the details of Alternate Form last. Total the cost of all the race's traits other than Alternate Form, subtract this total from the cost of the template the race transforms into, and use the difference to calculate the cost of Alternate Form for the race. Add the cost of Alternate Form to that of the race's other abilities to determine final racial cost. Example: Forest Dwarves can turn into sapient bears. Excluding Alternate Form, the racial traits of Forest Dwarves total 25 points. The bear template is worth 125 points. The difference is 125 - 25 = 100 points. Thus, the cost of Alternate Form is 15 + (0.9 x 100) = 105 points. This makes the Forest Dwarf template worth 25 + 105 = 130 points.  Special Limitations Cosmetic: You can assume a second, distinct appearance with no change in abilities or racial template. -50%.",

  "advantage-morph": "Morph",
  "advantage-morph-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "advantage-morph-description": "This ability is similar to Alternate Form, but not limited to specific racial templates. You can assume any racial template, within certain limits. First, the racial template must already exist in your game world. The GM might design the template himself or take one from a GURPS worldbook, but you cannot design totally new templates for the purpose of Morph (you can adjust existing ones, though; see below). Second, you can only turn into a living being, or a formerly living being such as a vampire. To change into a machine requires a special enhancement. Finally, the template's point value must be within a limit determined by the number of points you have in Morph. If you can assume any racial template worth no more than your native one, Morph costs 100 points. This makes many forms available – anything no more powerful than your native form. For a human, this includes cats, insects, owls, and wolves. If you can assume more powerful forms, add the difference between the maximum racial template cost and the cost of your native template to the base 100 points. For instance, a human who can take on any racial template worth up to 75 points would pay 175 points for Morph. You may improve this limit with earned character points. You can always take on the form of a being you can see or touch, provided its racial template cost does not exceed your maximum. Once you have assumed a form, you can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows you to shapeshift into that form at any time. You can memorize a number of forms equal to your IQ. If all your 'slots' are full, you must overwrite a previously memorized form (your choice) to add the new form. As with Alternate Form, the racial template of whatever you turn into replaces your native racial template. You may not add traits to templates, but you may freely omit racial mental disadvantages (e.g., Bestial), and you may always choose to drop the racial IQ modifier from a template and use your own IQ. Such changes raise the cost of animal templates, which are cheap due to limited mental capabilities. If you intend to do this, you should spend more than the minimum 100 points on Morph. Morph includes the ability to make cosmetic changes. This lets you impersonate a specific member of any race you can turn into. You can always impersonate someone who is present – but to assume his form later on, you must commit a memory 'slot' to that form. With enough points in Morph, you can use this function to improve appearance. For instance, 115 points in Morph would let you give yourself any appearance from Horrific to Handsome. Cosmetic changes still take the usual 10 seconds. Shapeshifting Races: Members of a race with the Morph ability must subtract the point cost of Morph from racial cost when determining what forms they can assume.  Example: Blue Blobs have a racial Morph ability worth 125 points – the basic ability, plus 25 points of extra capacity. This lets them assume forms worth 25 points more than their native one. With their other traits, their total racial cost is 175 points. However, for the purpose of Morph, they are considered to have a racial cost of 175 - 125 = 50 points. With their 25 points of additional capacity, Blue Blobs can turn into creatures worth up to 75 points.  Special Enhancements Unlimited: You can become anything the GM has defined with a racial template. This lets you turn into robots, vehicles, etc. as well as living beings. Most ordinary inanimate objects – such as bricks and toasters – are worth 0 points or less. With the GM's permission, you can become a typical example of an object like this without the need for a specific racial template. +50%.  Special Limitations Cosmetic: You can only change your outward appearance. Your abilities and racial template are unaffected. -50%. This limitation includes Mass Conservation, but not Retains Shape. Mass Conservation: All your forms have the same weight. If the weight of your native form falls outside the normal racial weight range for a race, you simply cannot become a member of that race. The GM should be merciless when enforcing this limitation – no 150-lb. mice or elephants! -20%. Retains Shape: You can only assume forms with the same number of limbs, body layout, posture, etc. as your native form. This would limit a human Morph to humanoids (e.g., elves and giants), a wolf Morph to horizontal quadrupeds, and a bird Morph to other birds. -20%.",

You return to normal size at the same rate. By default, you cannot carry any equipment, not even clothing, when you shrink. The ability to carry objects while shrunk is an enhancement. When you shrink, find your new height from the Size Modifier Table (p. 19). Every -6 to SM reduces height by a factor of 10. Reduce Move, reach, damage (with unarmed attacks, Innate Attacks, or shrunken weapons), HP, and DR in proportion to height. Every full -2 to SM also reduces weight by a factor of 10; for odd-numbered levels, treat the extra -1 as an additional factor of 3 (e.g., -3 to SM reduces weight by a factor of 30). Example: A 5'10'-tall character (SM 0) has Shrinking 12. This lets him shrink until he has SM -12, reducing his height by a factor of 100 (to about 0.7').

The items you snatch do not come from your own world, but from some nameless parallel; therefore, you can never intentionally take something away from a specific other person. Note that this talent does not allow you to visit alternate worlds in person – only to steal from them. To make a snatch, you must first concentrate for 10 seconds and clearly visualize the item you want. The item must be able to fit in one hand, and cannot weigh more than 5 lbs. You should have a hand free (if your hands are tied, you roll at -3), and others can see you making 'reaching' motions with that hand. Next, make an IQ roll for the snatch attempt. If you are trying for information in any form, the GM makes this roll for you (see below). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, the desired item appears in your hand – or sitting within arm's reach, if you prefer. On a failure, you obtain nothing. On a critical failure, you snatched the wrong item! This item is not immediately dangerous unless you were trying for something dangerous. Regardless of success or failure, each snatch attempt costs 2 FP.  Items Available In theory, you can get anything. In practice, some things are so hard to find that it is little use trying for them. You have a good chance of getting any item that exists, or that ever existed, in your own world – or any reasonably similar item. If the desired item is unusual, the GM may apply a penalty to the IQ roll: Item is significantly different from anything that ever appeared in your own world: -1 or more (GM's option). You could visualize 'a perfect diamond, bright green, the size of a hen's egg, carved into the shape of a typewriter,' but you might be rolling at -20! Item is unique or almost unique in any one world (e.g., the Hope Diamond): -3 or worse (GM's option).  You cannot clearly visualize what you want: -4 or worse (GM's option). Even on a 'success,' you might not get what you were really hoping for. You cannot get an item that works by natural laws wholly different from those in your world. For instance, if your world is nonmagical (or has no magic that you know of), you cannot snatch a magic item, because you are unable to visualize it properly; you would get a pretty but powerless mundane item. Similarly, if you are from a low-TL world, you could not get a laser pistol; you wouldn't be able to visualize it well, and your best effort would be a broken or toy gun. (A generous GM might bend this rule on a critical success ... and then let the poor Snatcher try to figure out how to use his amulet or laser pistol without killing himself.) Information is not available except in the form of 'ordinary' textbooks, reports, etc. You can grab a history book, but you can't ask for 'The Book of What Happens Next in My Adventure.' Note that the GM makes the roll if information is requested. If the roll fails by 5 or more, the information comes from an alternate world with different history, physics, etc., and is wrong – maybe subtly, maybe not subtly at all!  Repeated Attempts If your snatch attempt is unsuccessful, you can immediately try to snatch the same or a similar object again. These 'repeated attempts' are made at a cumulative -1 to the IQ roll. Each repeated attempt costs 4 FP instead of the usual 2 FP. To eliminate these penalties, wait one hour between attempts. The GM should be strict about attempts to circumvent this. For instance, a '.45 pistol' is not very different from a '.357 pistol' for the purpose of this advantage. Furthermore, ignore critical successes on repeated attempts made in quick succession. If the snatch being attempted is very difficult, there is little choice but to wait an hour between attempts.  Duration The objects you snatch remain until you voluntarily return them or use your Snatcher ability again. To keep objects indefinitely, take the Permanent enhancement (below).  Special Enhancements Permanent: Objects you snatch don't vanish when you use your ability again. The GM is free to forbid this enhancement, as it allows a single Snatcher to amass boundless wealth by snatching small, valuable objects. +300%.

The GM sets the limitation value using the guidelines under Accessibility (p. 110). Stunning: You are mentally stunned after a successful snatch. -10%. Unpredictable: On a failed IQ roll, you get something, but it isn't what you wanted. The worse the failure, the more different the item is. If you wanted a loaded pistol, failure by 1 might bring an unloaded pistol. Failure by 2 could mean a water pistol, failure by 3 a book on 'How to Shoot,' and so on ... with a critical failure bringing a live hand grenade. Any critical failure is dangerous, regardless of what you were looking for! -25%.",

They give up seats, let you ahead of them in lines, and receive your every word as pearls of wisdom. They also take great pains to prevent you from putting yourself in danger or even discomfort – even when you need to do so! Example: an elderly person in many societies.  Feared: Others will react to you much as if you had successfully used Intimidation skill (p. 202). Those who like you stand aside, while those who dislike you flee rather than risk a confrontation. You are met with silent deference, and perhaps even respect, but never friendly familiarity. Examples: a god among men or an Amazon warrior. Respected: You receive polite and obsequious deference, much as if you had high Status (p. 28), regardless of your actual Status.

This effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only; thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills. (Generalists will find it more costeffective to raise attributes.) • A bonus of +1 per level on all reaction rolls made by anyone in a position to notice your Talent, if he would be impressed by your aptitude (GM's judgment). To receive this bonus, you must demonstrate your Talent – most often by using the affected skills. • A reduction in the time required to learn the affected skills in play, regardless of how you learn them. Reduce the time required by 10% per level of Talent; e.g., Animal Friend 2 would let you learn animal-related skills in 80% the usual time. This has no effect on the point cost of your skills. You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4.  Cost of Talents The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected: Small (6 or fewer related skills): 5 points/level. Medium (7 to 12 related skills): 10 points/level. Large (13 or more related skills): 15 points/level. Skills with multiple specialties are considered to be one skill for this purpose. Once you buy a Talent, the list of affected skills is fixed. (Exception: The GM may rule that a Talent affects new skills appearing in later GURPS supplements, or skills he invents in the course of the campaign, if the Talent would logically be of value to those skills.)  Examples of Talents The following Talents are considered standard, and exist in most campaigns: Animal Friend: Animal Handling, Falconry, Packing, Riding, Teamster, and Veterinary. Reaction bonus: all animals. 5 points/level. Artificer: Armoury, Carpentry, Electrician, Electronics Repair, Engineer, Machinist, Masonry, Mechanic, and Smith. Reaction bonus: anyone you do work for. 10 points/level. Business Acumen: Accounting, Administration, Economics, Finance, Gambling, Market Analysis, Merchant, and Propaganda. Reaction bonus: anyone you do business with. 10 points/level. Gifted Artist: Artist, Jeweler, Leatherworking, Photography, and Sewing. Reaction bonus: anyone buying or critiquing your work. 5 points/level. Green Thumb: Biology, Farming, Gardening, Herb Lore, and Naturalist. Reaction bonus: gardeners and sentient plants. 5 points/level. Healer: Diagnosis, Esoteric Medicine, First Aid, Pharmacy, Physician, Physiology, Psychology, Surgery, and Veterinary. Reaction bonus: patients, both past and present. 10 points/level. Mathematical Ability: Accounting, Astronomy, Cryptography, Engineer, Finance, Market Analysis, Mathematics, and Physics. Reaction bonus: engineers and scientists. 10 points/level.  Musical Ability: Group Performance (Conducting), Musical Composition, Musical Influence, Musical Instrument, and Singing. Reaction bonus: anyone listening to or critiquing your work. 5 points/level. Outdoorsman: Camouflage, Fishing, Mimicry, Naturalist, Navigation, Survival, and Tracking. Reaction bonus: explorers, nature lovers, and the like. 10 points/level. Smooth Operator: Acting, Carousing, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Intimidation, Leadership, Panhandling, Politics, Public Speaking, Savoir-Faire, Sex Appeal, and Streetwise. Reaction bonus: con artists, politicians, salesmen, etc. – but only if you are not trying to manipulate them. 15 points/level.  Custom Talents At the GM's option, you may create your own Talent with a custom skill list.

Inflicts thrust-1 large piercing damage. 1 point. Fangs: Like those of a Smilodon. Inflict thrust-1 impaling damage. 2 points.  Telecommunication Mental or Physical; Exotic Variable  You can communicate over long distances without speaking aloud. You can send words at the speed of ordinary speech or pictures at the speed at which you could draw them. To establish contact requires one second of concentration and an IQ roll. After that, no concentration is required. You can maintain multiple contacts, but the IQ roll is at a cumulative -1 per contact after the first. Telecommunication works amid even the loudest noises, although interference and jamming can disrupt your signal. Those with suitable equipment may attempt to locate, intercept, or jam your transmission. This requires an Electronics Operation (Communications) roll for an electromagnetic signal, an Electronics Operation (Psychotronics) roll for a psionic signal, and so forth. Each variety of Telecommunication is a separate advantage with its own benefits and drawbacks. Some forms have limited range, which you can adjust using Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). Infrared Communication: You communicate using a modulated infrared beam. Base range is 500 yards in a direct line of sight. The short range and line-of-sight requirement make jamming and eavesdropping almost impossible under normal circumstances. You can only communicate with those who have this advantage or an infrared communicator. 10 points. Laser Communication: You communicate using a modulated laser beam. Base range is 50 miles in a direct line of sight. The narrow beam and line-of-sight requirement make it extremely hard to eavesdrop on you. You can only communicate with people who have this advantage or a laser communicator. 15 points. Radio: You communicate using radio waves. Base range is 10 miles. Your signal is omnidirectional, but because you can shift frequencies, eavesdroppers must still roll vs. Electronics Operation (Communications) to listen in. A side benefit of this ability is that you can receive AM, FM, CB, and other ordinary radio signals on an IQ roll (takes one second). Note that radio-frequency 'noise' from lightning and unshielded electronics can interfere with Radio. Radio does not work at all underwater. 10 points.  Telesend: You can transmit thoughts directly to others via magic, psi, or other exotic means (be specific!). Your subject receives your thoughts even if he lacks this ability. Range is theoretically unlimited, but the IQ roll to use this ability takes the range penalties given under LongDistance Modifiers (p. 241). If you cannot see or otherwise sense your subject, you have an additional penalty: -1 for family, lovers, or close friends; -3 for casual friends and acquaintances; or -5 for someone met only briefly. 30 points.  Special Enhancements Broadcast: This enhancement is only available for Telesend. It lets you send your thoughts to everyone in a radius around you. This requires an IQ roll at the long-distance modifier for the desired radius, plus an additional -4. +50%. Short Wave: This is only available for Radio. You can bounce your signal off a planet's ionosphere (if the planet has one). This lets you transmit to (or receive from) any point on the planet. Note that solar flares, weather, etc. can disrupt short-wave communications. +50%. Universal: Your messages are automatically translated into your subject's language. The GM may limit this enhancement to individuals from advanced tech levels, or restrict it to Telesend. +50%. Video: You are not limited to simple pictures! You can transmit real-time video of anything you can see. +40%.  Special Limitations Racial: Your ability only works on those of your own race or a very similar race, per Mind Reading (p. 69). -20%. Receive Only: You can receive but not send. This limitation is not available for Telesend. -50%. Send Only: You can send but not receive. This limitation is not available for Telesend. -50%. Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%. Vague: You cannot send speech or pictures. You can only send a simple code (e.g., Morse code) – or general concepts and emotions, in the case of Telesend. -50%.  Telekinesis Mental or Physical; Exotic 5 points/level  You can move objects without touching them. In effect, you manifest an invisible force that acts under your conscious direction at a distant point. Specify how you do this; possibilities include magnetism, psionic psychokinesis, an ultra-tech 'tractor beam,' or a supernatural 'poltergeist effect.' You can manipulate distant objects just as if you were grasping them in a pair of hands with ST equal to your Telekinesis (TK) level. You can move any object you have strength enough to lift, at a Move equal to your TK level, modified as usual for encumbrance level (see Encumbrance and Move, p. 17). Regardless of level, maximum range is 10 yards. To modify range, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). Telekinesis requires constant concentration to use. In combat, this means you must take a Concentrate maneuver on your turn. Your TK may then perform one standard maneuver as if were a disembodied pair of hands at some point within your range: a Ready maneuver to pick up an object; a Move maneuver to lift and carry it; an Attack maneuver to throw it, or to grab or strike directly; and so on.   Example: On your turn in combat, you take a Concentrate maneuver and state that your TK is taking an Attack maneuver to grab a gun from a foe. The following turn, you can Concentrate again and specify that your TK is taking an Aim or Wait maneuver to cover your enemy with the gun, an Attack maneuver to shoot him, or a Move maneuver to bring the gun to your hand. No rolls are necessary for ordinary lifting and movement. For more complex actions, the GM might require you to make a DX or skill roll. In situations where you would roll against ST, roll against your TK level instead. All of the above assumes that you are using TK to perform a task at a distance. TK can also discreetly assist you with such skills as Gambling (especially to cheat!), Lockpicking, and Surgery. In general, anything that would benefit from High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) gets a +4 bonus if you can successfully make an IQ roll to use your TK properly. On a failure, the GM may assess any penalty he feels is appropriate.   Grappling and Striking: You can use TK to attack a foe directly. Roll against DX or an unarmed combat skill to hit. Your foe defends as if attacked by an invisible opponent (see Visibility, p. 394). If you grapple, your foe cannot grab hold of the TK force, but he can try to break free as usual – and if he also has TK, he can take a Concentrate maneuver and use his TK level instead of his ST. The turn after you grapple a foe using TK, your TK can use a Move maneuver to pick him up off the ground, provided you have enough TK to lift his weight. Someone in this position can't do anything that relies on ground contact (run, retreat, etc.), but can perform any other action that is possible while grappled.  Levitation: If you have enough TK to lift your own body weight, you can levitate. Take the Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take Move maneuvers to propel your body. For true psychokinetic flight, take Flight (p. 56) with the Psychokinetic limitation (below). Throwing: By applying a TK impulse for a fraction of a second, you can throw objects faster (and farther) than you can move them. Take a Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take an Attack maneuver. This works just as if you were throwing the object with ST equal to your TK level. Roll against Throwing or Thrown Weapon skill to hit, depending on the object being hurled. For 1/2D and Max purposes, measure range from the object (not yourself!) to the target; for the purpose of range penalties, use the sum of the distance from you to the object and from the object to the target. Once you throw something, you have 'released' your telekinetic grip – your TK must take a Ready maneuver to pick it up again.  Special Limitations Magnetic: Your TK is 'super magnetism,' and only affects ferrous metals: iron (including steel), nickel, and cobalt. -50%. Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256). This makes it mental (2) rather than physical (3). -10%. Visible: Your TK is not an invisible force, but a disembodied hand, glowing 'tractor beam,' or similar. This makes it much easier for others to defend against your TK attacks (do not use the Visibility rules). -20%.",

For that, buy Innate Attack – usually either burning (for flame) or fatigue (for attacks that damage by altering body temperature).  Special Limitations Cold: You can only decrease the temperature. -50%. Heat: You can only increase the temperature. -50%.

  "advantage-temperature-tolerance-description": "Every character has a temperature 'comfort zone' within which he suffers no ill effects (such as FP or HP loss) due to heat or cold. For ordinary humans, this zone is 55° wide and falls between 35° and 90°. For nonhumans, the zone can be centered anywhere, but this is a 0-point feature for a zone no larger than 55°. A larger zone is an advantage. Each level of Temperature Tolerance adds HT degrees to your comfort zone, distributed in any way you wish between the 'cold' and 'hot' ends of the zone. Temperature Tolerance confers no special resistance to attacks by fire or ice unless the only damage is a result of a rise or fall in the ambient temperature. In particular, it cannot help you if your body temperature is being manipulated. In a realistic campaign, the GM should limit normal humans to Temperature Tolerance 1 or 2. However, high levels of this trait are likely for nonhumans with fur or a heavy layer of fat.",

If you wish to use this ability in combat – to repel zombies, for instance – then you must choose the Concentrate maneuver each turn, and can do nothing else. For as long as you assert your faith, no malign supernatural entity (GM's judgment as to what this covers) may approach within one yard of you. If one is forced into this radius, it must leave by the most direct route possible, as if it suffered from Dread (p. 132). If it cannot leave without coming closer, it must make a Will roll. On a success, it may run past you to escape, pushing you aside if necessary (but using only the minimum force required to escape). On a failure, the monster is cowed. It must cower, helplessly, and cannot move, defend itself, or take any other action. To keep True Faith, you must behave in a manner consistent with your religion.

You lose the use of any limb that receives a crippling wound, and you might even lose the limb itself. You can even lose attribute levels, advantages, etc. to disease, injury, or poison. However, you will only die if your body is physically destroyed – and sometimes not even then. This advantage comes in three levels: Unkillable 1: Injury affects you normally, but you need never make a HT roll to stay alive. You can survive (and even function, if you remain conscious) down to -10xHP, at which point your body is physically destroyed and you die. As long as you are alive, you heal at your usual rate – typically 1 HP/day, modified for any Regeneration (p. 80) you may have. Crippled limbs do heal, but severed limbs are gone for good unless you have Regrowth (p. 80). 50 points. Unkillable 2: As Unkillable 1, but you do not die at -10xHP. Once you reach -10xHP, you are reduced to an indestructible skeleton and automatically fall unconscious. You sustain no further damage from any attack. Once the damage stops, you heal normally – even if you've been hacked to pieces – and any severed body parts will grow back. You regain consciousness once you have positive HP. Note that your enemies can imprison your remains while you are unconscious, or even expose them to a source of continuous damage (fire is a common choice) to prevent you from healing. 100 points. Unkillable 3: As Unkillable 2, except that at -10xHP, you become a ghost, an energy pattern, or some other incorporeal form that cannot be contained or damaged through normal means. At this stage, you fall unconscious and heal normally. Once you are at full HP, your fully intact body will coalesce in a location of the GM's choosing. 150 points. With the GM's permission, if you have Unkillable 2 or 3 and are taken to -10xHP, you can trade in Unkillable and use the points to buy a spirit or undead racial template (if such things exist in the setting), becoming a ghost, revenant, etc. once you heal all your HP. By default, you age normally, and will eventually die of old age. To be truly immortal, combine Unkillable with Unaging (above) – and possibly one or more of Doesn't Breathe (p.49), Injury Tolerance (p. 60), Regeneration (p. 80), and Resistant (p. 80).  Special Limitations Achilles' Heel: Damage from one particular source (possibly one to which you have a Vulnerability, p. 161) can kill you normally. You must make normal HT rolls to survive at -HP and below, and die automatically if this damage takes you below -5xHP. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the attack, as defined under Limited Defenses (p. 46): -10% if 'Rare,' -30% if 'Occasional,' or -50% if 'Common' or 'Very Common.' Hindrance: A specific substance (e.g., silver or wood) prevents healing – whether by natural means or Regeneration – for as long as it remains in your body. Once you pass out from your injuries, you stay dormant until this substance is removed. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the substance: -5% if 'Rare,' -15% if 'Occasional,' or -25% if 'Common.' Reincarnation: This is only available for Unkillable 2 or 3. When reduced to -10xHP, you recover at your usual rate, but you wake up in an entirely new body with new abilities. The GM creates the new form (or may allow you to do so), but you always retain the Unkillable advantage. -20%. Trigger: This is only available for Unkillable 2 or 3. Once reduced to -10xHP, you require some substance (such as human blood) or condition (such as a ritual) before you will start to heal. Until then, you will remain dormant.

'Special abilities' might mean cinematic traits, magic spells, exotic advantages (for a human), supernatural advantages (for anyone), or almost anything else – it depends on the setting. Players are free to suggest Unusual Backgrounds to the GM, but the GM decides whether a proposed Unusual Background is acceptable, and if so, what its cost and benefits are.  Example 1: 'Raised by wizards' to justify access to magic spells might be a 0-point special effect in a fantasy world where magic is common, a 10point Unusual Background in a conspiracy campaign where magic is known but kept secret, and a 50-point Unusual Background – or simply forbidden – in a horror game where a PC who wields supernatural power would reduce the suspense. Example 2: 'Daughter of the God of Magic' to justify the Unkillable advantage would be an Unusual Background in any setting, and would be worth as much as the advantage itself – 50 points or more – if the GM allowed it at all. Not every unusual character concept merits an Unusual Background. The GM should only charge points when the character enjoys a tangible benefit.

In a perfectly still, dark chamber, you would have only a vague notion of the size of the area, but you would be able to sense a barrier before you ran into it, and could find openings by sensing the flow of air or water. To use Vibration Sense, make a Sense roll. Consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) and apply separate bonuses for the target's size and speed, and a penalty for the range to the target. Wind (in air) or swift currents (in water) will generate 'noise' that interferes with your sense. Find the speed of the wind or current on the table and assess the relevant speed penalty.

  "advantage-warp-type": "Mental; Supernatural",
  "advantage-warp-description": "You have the ability to teleport, traveling from point to point without moving through the intervening space. To do so, you must be able to see your destination with your own eyes, or view it remotely (via closed-circuit TV, someone else's eyes using Mind Reading with the Sensory enhancement, etc.), or visualize it clearly (which is only possible if you have visited it previously in person).  You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (p. 74). To carry more, or to bring along other people, take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below). Make an IQ roll to activate your ability, modified as follows: Distance: Distance penalties appear on the table below. If actual distance falls between two values, use the higher. Distance      Penalty 10 yards      0 20 yards      -1 100 yards     -2 500 yards     -3 2 miles       -4 10 miles      -5 100 miles     -6 1,000 miles   -7  Add an additional -1 for each 10x increase in distance. Preparation Time: The amount of time taken to prepare for the teleport affects the IQ roll, as follows: Preparation Time    IQ Modifier None                -10 1 second            -5 2 seconds           -4 4 seconds           -3 8 seconds           -2 15 seconds          -1 30 seconds          0 1 minute            +1 2 minutes           +2 4 minutes           +3 8 minutes           +4 15 minutes          +5 30 minutes          +6 1 hour              +7 2 hours             +8 4 hours             +9 8 hours             +10  This table is not open-ended; +10 is the maximum possible bonus. Removal: If you have a 'secondhand' view of the destination, you are at -2 per level of removal. For instance, seeing it on TV or through someone else's eyes would give -2, while seeing it on a television set that you are viewing through someone else's eyes would give -4. There is an additional -2 to teleport to a place you have visited but cannot see. Fatigue Points: Apply a bonus of +1 per FP spent. You must declare this before you roll, and you lose the FP whether you succeed or fail. You never have to spend FP, but it is usually a good idea if you must travel far or without much preparation.  On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere and strain your power: you are at -5 to use it again in the next 10 minutes. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination. This can be anywhere the GM wishes! It need not be dangerous, but it should seriously inconvenience you. In addition, your power temporarily 'burns out' and will not function again for 1d hours. You can use Warp to evade attacks in combat. Once per turn, you may teleport to any location you can see within 10 yards, instantly. This is considered a dodge. Of course, the IQ roll will be at -10 for instant use, so you might want to spend FP to improve your odds! You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. You cannot take Reduced Fatigue Cost or Reduced Time (p. 108); instead, take Reliable (below) so that you will need less time or fewer FP to teleport reliably.  Special Enhancements Blind: You can teleport to a specific set of coordinates (distance and direction) without seeing or having visited the destination. This gives you an extra -5 to your IQ roll! You must pay two FP per +1 bonus when using this enhancement. +50%. Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; ExtraHeavy, +50%.   Reliable: Your power is stable and predictable. Each level of this enhancement gives +1 to the IQ roll to use this ability, allowing you to teleport with little preparation (e.g., in combat) or over long distances without spending as many FP to improve your odds. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +10. Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Jumper advantage (p. 64). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. If you are both a time and world-jumper, and wish to use Warp with both abilities, buy this enhancement twice. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary – one per ability – and it is possible for one to succeed while the other fails, or for both to fail. +10% per linked Jumper advantage.  Special Limitations Hyperjump: You physically move through 'hyperspace' or 'jump space' to journey between destinations. This is not true, instantaneous teleportation; you have an effective speed, which means the trip takes time. On long trips, you will need to address life-support needs! In addition, you cannot activate Hyperjump in atmosphere and you cannot travel distances shorter than one light-second (186,000 miles, -10 to IQ). This effectively limits you to space travel. There is one benefit to Hyperjump: if you possess  Navigation (Hyperspace) skill, you may substitute it for IQ. -50% if your effective speed is the speed of light (every 186,000 miles traveled takes one second); -25% if you can travel one light-year (-17 to IQ) per day.

Examples: all swords, all ninja weapons. 35 points. A small class of weapons. Examples: fencing weapons (maingauche, rapier, saber, and smallsword), knightly weapons (broadsword, mace, shield, and lance). 30 points. Two weapons normally used together. Examples: broadsword and shield, rapier and main-gauche. 25 points. One specific weapon. 20 points. In all cases, if a weapon can be thrown, the benefits of this advantage also apply when throwing that weapon. When using a suitable weapon, add +1 per die to basic thrust or swing damage if you know the relevant weapon skill at DX+1. Add +2 per die if you know that skill at DX+2 or better. You also have half the usual penalty to make a Rapid Strike (see Melee Attack Options, p. 369), or to parry more than once per turn (see Parrying, p. 376). None of these benefits apply to default use. You are familiar with – if not proficient in – every weapon within your class. This gives you an improved default: DX/Easy weapon skills default to DX-1, DX/Average ones to DX-2, and DX/Hard ones to DX-3. Note that these skills are no easier to learn, and may not be 'bought up' from the improved defaults in order to save points. Finally, you may learn any cinematic skill that names this advantage as a prerequisite (see Chapter 4) – e.g., Blind Fighting and Power Blow – if you could reasonably use that skill with your weapons of choice.

Once per game session per level of this advantage, you may attempt a roll against any skill, using your score in the appropriate attribute: IQ for IQ-based skills, DX for DX-based skills, etc. You do not incur any default penalties, but situational and equipment modifiers apply normally, as do any modifiers for advantages or disadvantages. Tech level is irrelevant: a TL3 monk could make an IQ roll to use Computer Programming/TL12! Wild Talent does apply to skills that normally have no default, provided you meet any advantage requirements. For instance, you could cast unknown magic spells provided you had Magery, or use unknown cinematic martial-arts skills provided you have Trained By A Master. Wild Talent has no effect on skills you already know.  Special Enhancements Retention: You can learn the skills you use! To do so, you must have one unspent character point available when you attempt the skill roll. On a success, you may buy the skill at the one-point level. You cannot improve a skill learned this way for one month, during which time you use it at -2. On a critical success, you can start improving the skill immediately, and there is no -2. On a failure, you cannot learn the skill; on a critical failure, you also lose your unspent character point! Regardless of success, if you lack any of the skill's prerequisites, your skill is at -4 until you acquire them, and you cannot improve the skill in the interim. This enhancement does not let you learn skills from a TL higher than your own. +25%.  Special Limitations Emergencies Only: Your Wild Talent only works in life-threatening situations, such as mortal combat. To use it, you must ask for a particular result related to your predicament. Your request must be specific (e.g., 'Get him away from me.'), but you cannot specify a skill (e.g., 'Use Judo' or 'Cast the Command spell'). The GM will then choose a skill that could bring about the desired result. He is not limited to mundane skills; he may choose a spell if you have Magery, a cinematic martial-arts skill if you have Trained By A Master, and so forth. Once the GM has chosen, roll against the governing attribute, as usual. If the GM feels you already have skills equal to the task, he will advise you on which skill to use. This still counts as one of your uses of Wild Talent! -30%.  Focused: You can only use (and if you have Retention, learn) one specific class of skills.

You have -5 on all IQ and IQ-based skill rolls, save those for the task you are currently concentrating on. If no engaging task or topic presents itself, your attention will drift to more interesting matters in five minutes, and you will ignore your immediate surroundings until something catches your attention and brings you back. Once adrift in your own thoughts, you must roll against Perception-5 in order to notice any event short of personal physical injury. You may attempt to rivet your attention on a boring topic through sheer strength of will. To do so, make a Will-5 roll once every five minutes. 'Boring topics' include small talk, repetitive manual tasks, guard duty, driving on an empty highway ... Absent-minded individuals also tend to forget trivial tasks (like paying the bills) and items (like car keys and checkbooks). Whenever it becomes important that you have performed such a task or brought such an item, the GM should call for a roll against IQ-2. On a failure, this detail slipped your attention. Example: An absent-minded detective is in a shootout. He was involved in gunplay earlier in the day, in which he fired four rounds, so the GM calls for an IQ-2 roll. The detective fails the roll, and discovers too late that he forgot to reload his weapon, so his revolver has only two bullets left! This is the classic disadvantage for eccentric geniuses.  Addiction Mental or Physical Variable  You are addicted to a drug, which you must use daily or suffer withdrawal. The value of this disadvantage depends on the cost, effects, and legality of the drug:  Cost (per day) Cheap (up to 0.1% of average starting wealth): -5 points.  Expensive (up to 0.5% of average starting wealth): -10 points. Very expensive (more than 0.5% of average starting wealth): -20 points.  Effects Incapacitating or hallucinogenic:-10 points. Highly addictive (-5 on withdrawal roll): -5 points. Totally addictive (-10 on withdrawal roll): -10 points.  Legality Illegal: +0 points. Legal: +5 points. Examples: Tobacco is cheap, highly addictive, and legal; a chain-smoker has a -5-point Addiction. Heroin is very expensive, incapacitating, totally addictive, and illegal; a heroin addict has a -40-point Addiction. Non-Chemical Addictions: You can take Addiction to an activity instead of a drug – for instance, telepathic contact or spending time in virtual reality. If this costs money, price the Addiction based on its daily cost. If it is free (e.g., telepathic contact), treat it as 'Cheap' if it you can do it almost anywhere (telepathic contact with anyone) or as 'Expensive' if restrictive conditions apply (telepathic contact with one specific person). Such Addictions almost always cause psychological dependency (see Withdrawal, below).  Effects of Drugs A stimulating drug leaves you feeling energized ... until it wears off. Then you are depressed and irritable. An incapacitating drug renders you unconscious (or just blissfully, uselessly drowsy) for about two hours. A hallucinogenic drug renders you useless for work or combat, though you might be active and talkative. Some drugs (e.g., tobacco) have none of these effects, while others have unique effects. Side effects are also possible. For detailed rules, see Addictive Drugs (p. 440).  Withdrawal Sometimes, voluntarily or otherwise, you must try to give up your Addiction. Addiction to a drug that  causes psychological dependency is a mental disadvantage; withdrawal from such a drug requires a series of Will rolls, and may result in mental problems. Addiction to a drug that induces physiological dependency is a physical disadvantage; withdrawal is a function of your HT, and may cause physical injury. For details, see Drug Withdrawal (p. 440). Should you successfully withdraw from an Addiction, you must immediately buy off this disadvantage.  Minor Addictions For an Addiction worth only -5 points, the GM may rule that the expense, stigma, and detrimental long-term effects of use are the whole of the disadvantage, and waive the usual withdrawal rules. This is appropriate for such drugs as tobacco and caffeine. If forced to go without, you must make a Will or HT roll as usual, but the only effects on a failure are general anxiety, irritability, or restlessness. This manifests as a temporary -1 to DX, IQ, self-control rolls, or reaction rolls (GM's choice) – not as insanity or injury. Successive failures prolong the duration of the effects; they do not increase the size of the penalty. If you can make 14 successful rolls in succession, you must buy off your Addiction. It is also possible to create a 0point Addiction using these rules. Such Addictions are always Minor Addictions, and you may take them as-1-point quirks (see Quirks, p. 162).",

It is cheap, incapacitating, and usually legal, so it would normally be a -10-point Addiction. But it is also insidious; therefore, it is worth-15 points – or -20 points if it is illegal. Most of the time, you may confine your drinking to the evenings, and therefore function normally (for game purposes). However, any time you are in the presence of alcohol, you must roll vs. Will to avoid partaking. A failed roll means you go on a 'binge' lasting  2d hours, followed by a hangover; see Drinking and Intoxication (p. 439). Alcoholics on a binge are characterized by sudden mood swings – from extreme friendliness to extreme hostility – and may attack friends, talk too freely, or make other mistakes. The other drawback of Alcoholism is that it is hard to get rid of. Should you manage to 'withdraw,' you no longer need to drink daily ... but you must still make a Will+4 roll whenever you are in the presence of alcohol. A failed roll does not reinstate the addiction, but does set off a binge. (Three binges in a week will reinstate the addiction.) Thus, there is no normal way to 'buy off' this disadvantage. Continued Alcoholism will steal your abilities. You must roll yearly against HT+2 until you withdraw.

You will do nearly anything – perhaps even risk death – to avoid the label 'dishonorable' (whatever that means). You must do more than pay lip service to a set of principles to get points for a Code of Honor. You must be a true follower of the Code! This is a disadvantage because it often requires dangerous – if not reckless – behavior. Furthermore, you can often be forced into unfair situations, because your foes know you are honorable. Code of Honor is not the same as Duty (p. 133) or Sense of Duty (p. 153). A samurai or British grenadier marches into battle against fearful odds out of duty, not for his personal honor (though of course he would lose honor by fleeing). The risks you take for your honor are solely on your own account. The point value of a particular Code of Honor depends on how much trouble it is liable to get you into and how arbitrary and irrational its requirements are. An informal Code that applies only among your peers is worth -5 points. A formal Code that applies only among peers, or an informal one that applies all the time, is worth -10 points. A formal Code that applies all the time, or that requires suicide if broken, is worth -15 points. The GM has the final say! Some examples: Code of Honor (Pirate's): Always avenge an insult, regardless of the danger; your buddy's foe is your own; never attack a fellow crewman or buddy except in a fair, open duel.  Anything else goes. This is also suitable for brigands, bikers, etc. -5 points. Code of Honor (Professional): Adhere to the ethics of your profession; always do your job to the best of your ability; support your guild, union, or professional association. This is most suitable for lawyers and physicians (Hippocratic Oath), but dedicated tradesmen, merchants, and so forth may have a similar Code. -5 points. Code of Honor (Gentleman's): Never break your word. Never ignore an insult to yourself, a lady, or your flag; insults may only be wiped out by an apology or a duel (not necessarily to the death!). Never take advantage of an opponent in any way; weapons and circumstances must be equal (except in open war). This only applies between gentlemen. A discourtesy from anyone of Status 0 or less calls for a whipping, not a duel! -10 points. Code of Honor (Soldier's): An officer should be tough but fair, lead from the front, and look out for his men; an enlisted man should look out for his buddies and take care of his kit. Every soldier should be willing to fight and die for the honor of his unit, service, and country; follow orders; obey the 'rules of war'; treat an honorable enemy with respect (a dishonorable enemy deserves a bullet); and wear the uniform with pride. -10 points.

You must indulge at least once per day, if at all possible, and do so any time you have the opportunity unless you can make a self-control roll. You seek to avoid any situation where you know you will be unable to indulge for more than a day. You must make a self-control roll to enter into such a situation; if you succeed (or are forced into the situation), you suffer from Bad Temper (p. 124) the whole time, with the same self-control roll as your Compulsive Behavior. It's bad roleplaying to try to avoid your compulsion regularly! The point value of this disadvantage depends on how much your habit costs and how much trouble it is likely to get you into. The GM is the final judge. Examples include: Compulsive Carousing: You cannot resist the urge to party! Once per day, you must seek out a social gathering and lounge around – feasting, drinking, singing, and joking – for at least an hour. If you are not invited, you crash the party; if there is no party, you attempt to liven things up. Money is no object! If you have it, you will spend it. You try almost any mindaltering substance without a second thought, never refuse a social drink, and aren't particularly picky about your romantic partners. You get +1 to reactions from like-minded extroverts, but -1 or worse from sober-minded citizens – and -4 in puritanical settings.-5 points (-10 points in puritanical settings). Compulsive Gambling: You cannot pass up an opportunity to gamble. Bets, wagers, games of chance, and even lotteries hold an uncanny fascination for you. If there is no game of chance or bet going, you will start one. You try any gambling game proposed to you, whether you know it or not. You do not have to have the Gambling skill, but if you don't, you will need a steady source of wealth! If you are prevented from gambling – for instance, by traveling with nongamblers – you will quickly earn a reaction penalty (-1 per -5 points in this disadvantage, after the self-control multiplier) by constantly talking about gambling and attempting to draw others into games or wagers. -5 points.*  Compulsive Generosity: You are too open-handed. If a beggar asks for cash, you give – and where others give copper, you give silver. You always listen to larger requests for financial aid, if they are even remotely plausible, and you must make a self-control roll whenever you hear a good hard-luck story (if you are broke when asked, you apologize profusely). You aren't a complete sucker – you just feel guilty about being better off than others. In a society with a lot of beggars around, increase your cost of living: Self-Control Number   Cost of Living Increase 6                     20% 9                     15% 12                    10% 15                    5% This may earn you a +1 reaction bonus from pious folk; if you are poor yourself, the reaction bonus may be even higher. This trait is incompatible with Miserliness. -5 points.* Compulsive Lying: You lie constantly, for no reason other than the joy of telling the tale. You delight in inventing stories about your deeds, lineage, wealth – whatever might impress your audience. Even when exposed as a liar, you cling to your stories tenaciously, calling your accuser a liar and a scoundrel. Make a self-control roll to tell the pure, unvarnished truth. If you fail, you lie – no matter how dire the consequences. When you roll to tell the truth to your fellow party members, roll out of sight of the other players. Thus, they can never be sure they are getting accurate information. -15 points.* Compulsive Spending: Cash just runs through your fingers! You enjoy being seen as a big spender, are too fond of luxury, or find the experience of buying to be fun – perhaps all three. Make a self-control roll whenever someone offers you a purchase that matches any of your quirks or interests, and the cash in your pocket is more than twice the asking price. If you fail, you buy. This raises your cost of living, and gives you a penalty to Merchant skill when you bargain or haggle: Self-Control Number    Cost of Living Increase   Merchant Skill Penalty 6                      80%                       -4 9                      40%                       -3 12                     20%                       -2 15                     10%                       -1  Compulsive Spending is not limited to the wealthy!

Occasional (very expensive or hard to find): -20 points. Common (expensive, somewhat hard to find): -10 points.  Very Common (available almost anywhere): -5 points. Add -5 points to these values for items that are illegal in your game world. Apply a multiplier based on the frequency with which you must receive the item: Constantly: You must carry and use the substance at all times – for example, an exotic atmosphere. Lose 1 HP per minute without the substance. x5. Hourly: Lose 1 HP per 10 minutes after missing an hourly dose. x4. Daily: Lose 1 HP per hour after missing a daily dose. x3.

Yearly: Lose 1 HP per two weeks after missing a yearly dose. x1/10 (drop all fractions).

With the GM's permission, normal humans may take this disadvantage to represent the special requirements of certain chronic illnesses. Not every life-support requirement qualifies as Dependency. Use Maintenance (p. 143) if you require skilled care – not a substance, object, or environment – to avoid HT loss (not injury).

If your Dependent ends up kidnapped or otherwise in danger during play, you must go to the rescue as soon as possible. If you don't go to his aid immediately, the GM can deny you bonus character points for 'acting out of character.' Furthermore, you never earn any character points for a game session in which your Dependent is killed or badly hurt. Three factors determine the disadvantage value of a Dependent: his competence, his importance (to you!), and his frequency of appearance.  Competence Specify the number of points your Dependent is built on.

If he appears as a Dependent, he shows up in a way that causes you trouble (e.g., he's captured). If he appears as an Ally, he manages to be helpful and take care of himself. If he appears as both, he is helpful and troublesome at the same time; for instance, he uses his skills to assist you, but also wanders off, is singled out by the enemy, or otherwise causes problems equal to the assistance he offers.

You may only risk harm to him if something very important (such as the safety of many other people) is at stake. x1. Loved one: The Dependent is a relative or a lover. You may not put anything before his safety! x2.  Frequency of Appearance Choose a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36). This should fit the 'story' behind the Dependent. If the Dependent were your infant child, for instance, it would be odd for him to appear 'quite rarely'!  Multiple Dependents You cannot earn points for more than two Dependents. However, if you have a group of Dependents, you may count the entire group as your two Dependents. Work out the value of an average member of the group as a Dependent, and then claim twice this point value. Example: A vigilante who is a schoolteacher by day could have 'generic dependents': all pupils. They are young (-10 points), around 'quite often' (x2), and count as 'friends' (x1), for -20 points each. However, the twoDependent limit lets the hero claim -40 points' worth of Dependents. (And if one gets hurt, there are always others.)  Dependents in Play As you earn points, the GM will scale your Dependent's abilities proportionally to keep his point total a fixed percentage of your own. Thus, his value as a disadvantage will not  change. Children grow up, adults earn money, and everyone learns new skills. Dependents who spend a lot of time around you might become adventurers in their own right. You are free to suggest reasonable improvements for your Dependents, but the GM's word is final. If your Dependent is killed, or so seriously injured that the GM decides he is effectively out of the campaign, you must make up the bonus points you got for him. You have three options: buy off the amount by spending earned character points, take a new disadvantage (e.g., Chronic Depression, p. 126), or get a new Dependent. New Dependents are usually inappropriate, but a mental disability brought on by the loss is a good solution. (Ever since the octopus got Amy, you've been afraid of the ocean ...)  Examples of Dependents • For anyone: elderly relatives, teachers, friends, children, younger brothers or sisters, lovers, husbands or wives. • For crimefighters: young sidekicks, reporters, or wards. • For wizards: apprentices. • For ship captains (ocean or space-going): ensigns or cabin boys. • For soldiers: orphans or new recruits. • For criminals or mad scientists: incompetent henchmen.",

This kind of Destiny comes in three levels: Minor Disadvantage: You are fated to play a small part in a larger story, and you will not come off so well.

  "disadvantage-duty-description": "If your occupation and social situation saddle you with a significant personal obligation toward others, and occasionally require you to obey hazardous orders, you have a 'Duty.' Duty most often accompanies Rank (p. 39), a Patron (p. 72), or one of the traits discussed under Privilege (p. 20). A particularly arduous job might qualify as a Duty, but most ordinary jobs would not. A wholly self-imposed feeling of duty is not a Duty, either (but it can still be a disadvantage; see Sense of Duty, p. 153). Finally, you cannot claim points for a Duty toward Dependents (p. 131); the points you get for Dependents already reflect your obligations in this regard.  The GM may restrict the Duties allowed in a campaign, or even forbid them entirely, if he feels they would unduly disrupt the flow of the adventure. If you have a Duty, the GM rolls at the beginning of each adventure to see whether it comes into play. Being 'called to duty' could delay your plans ... or be the reason for the adventure! Alternatively, your master might give you a secret agenda to pursue, or his associates might harass you while you are officially 'on leave.' If you try to avoid your Duty, your GM is within his rights to penalize you for bad roleplaying. The basic point cost of a Duty depends on the frequency with which comes up in play: Almost all the time (roll of 15 or less): -15 points. At this level, the GM may rule that you are always on duty. Quite often (roll of 12 or less): -10 points. Fairly often (roll of 9 or less): -5 points. Quite rarely (roll of 6 or less): -2 points. This cost is for an occasionally hazardous Duty imposed through normal social means. If this does not describe your Duty, you should modify the cost: Extremely Hazardous: You are always at risk of death or serious injury when your Duty comes up. There are significant penalties if you refuse to take these risks: dismissal in disgrace, imprisonment, perhaps even death. The GM has the final say as to whether a given Duty is 'extremely hazardous' in his campaign. -5 points. Involuntary: Your Duty is enforced by threats to you or your loved ones, or is imposed by exotic mind control, a curse, etc. This is unrelated to how hazardous the Duty is when you carry it out – the danger here lies in what will happen if you don't carry it out! A Duty can be Involuntary and either Extremely Hazardous or Nonhazardous. -5 points. Nonhazardous: Your Duty never requires you to risk your life. This option is mutually exclusive with Extremely Hazardous. +5 points. (If this raises the cost of your Duty to 0 points or more, the obligation is too trivial to qualify as a Duty.)  Examples Example 1: A mayor is indebted to the crime lord who got him elected. His benefactor rarely calls on him for favors (-2 points), but since the mayor faces blackmail or violence if he refuses to comply, his Duty is Involuntary. Duty (Crime Lord, 6 or less; Involuntary) is worth -7 points. Example 2: A commando is always on duty (-15 points). He might see only a handful of combat assignments in his whole career, but these will be deadly. And his daily routine calls for him to jump out of planes, hike through snake-infested jungles, and train with live ammo.

Some Enemies want to kill you ... others have more devious goals. Determine the nature of your Enemy when you create your character, and explain to the GM why the Enemy is after you. The GM is free to fill in additional details as he sees fit. Three factors determine the disadvantage value of an Enemy: its power, its intent, and its frequency of appearance.  Power The more powerful the Enemy, the more points it is worth as a disadvantage. The GM sets this value. Note that when your Enemy is an organization, the point value is based on the number of individuals who are after you – not on the total size of the group! One person, less powerful than the PC (built on about 50% of the PC's starting points). -5 points. One person, equal in power to the PC (built on about 100% of the PC's starting points), or a small group of less-powerful people (3 to 5 people). Examples: A mad scientist, or the four brothers of the man you killed in a duel. -10 points. One person, more powerful than the PC (built on at least 150% of the PC's starting points), or a mediumsized group of less-powerful people (6 to 20 people). Examples: a single superhuman or a city police department (which numbers in the hundreds, but they're not all after you at once). -20 points. A large group of less-powerful people (21 to 1,000 people), or a mediumsized group that includes some formidable or superhuman individuals. Examples: the FBI or the Mafia. -30 points. An entire government, a whole guild of powerful wizards, an organization of supers, or some other utterly formidable group. -40 points.  Special Cases There are two special cases for which you should adjust the costs given above before multiplying for intent and frequency of appearance:  Evil Twin: Your Enemy looks and sounds like you, and perhaps even uses your name, but acts completely opposite. Often, others will think you suffer from Split Personality (p. 156), and react appropriately (-3 to reactions). You might never meet your Evil Twin, but you will hear about him – usually when you're taking the blame for something you didn't do. Normally, an Evil Twin has exactly the same skills and abilities as you, but his mental disadvantages are opposite or skewed. This makes him an even match: a -10-point Enemy. If he is more capable than you, he is worth extra points, because he is better equipped to make you look insane, and you are less able to predict and thwart his actions.  Frequency of Appearance Choose a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 26). Roll at the beginning of each adventure, or at the start of each session of a continuing adventure.  Limits on Enemies You may not take more than two Enemies, or claim more than -60 points in Enemies. (If the whole U.S. government is out to get you, the fact that your old college professor has lost his mind, and is also after you, pales to insignificance.)  Intent The more unpleasant the Enemy's intentions, the more you multiply its worth in points.  Watcher: Your Enemy stalks you or spies on you. This is annoying, and makes it hard to keep secrets, but it is rarely more than a minor inconvenience. Examples: an aggressive journalist dogging a politician, detectives shadowing a suspected criminal. x1/4. Rival: Your Enemy wishes to upstage or inconvenience you, or plays cruel practical jokes on you (this is typical of most Evil Twins), but stops short of anything that would do lasting harm. Examples: a politician's bitter political rival, detectives harassing a suspected criminal. x1/2. Hunter: The Enemy intends to arrest, bankrupt, injure, or otherwise harm you in some lasting way – or simply wants to kill you. Examples: an assassin gunning for a politician, detectives out to arrest a suspected criminal. x1.   Enemies in Play If the dice indicate that an Enemy should show up, the GM must decide how and where the Enemy becomes involved. If an Enemy is very powerful, or if a number of different Enemies show up at the same time, this may influence the whole adventure. If you take an extremely powerful Enemy, you are likely to be jailed or killed before long. So it goes. You can get a 60-point bonus by taking Enemy (FBI, 12 or less; Hunter), but your every adventure will be that of a hunted criminal. Even with an extra 60 points, your career may be short. If you start with a weak Enemy, or play cleverly, you might manage to eliminate your foe or permanently change his attitude toward you. But as the saying goes, 'There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.' If you get rid of an Enemy, you have three choices:  1. Pay enough character points to buy off the original bonus you got for that Enemy. 2. Take a disadvantage to make up for the point bonus. For instance, you might have been kicked in the head during the final battle, leaving you partially deaf. Or a giant spider might have attacked you, leaving you with arachnophobia. The new disadvantage should have the same point cost as your former Enemy (or less, if you want to buy off part of the disadvantage). If you cannot think of a good substitute disadvantage, the GM will be more than happy to supply one! 3. Take a new Enemy of equal value. You might have destroyed the fiendish Dr. Scorpion – but his brother is continuing his evil work.  Evil Twin is more skilled than you or possesses abilities that you do not (GM decides): -5 points. Evil Twin is more skilled than you and possesses abilities that you do not (GM decides): -10 points. Unknown: You know you have an Enemy, but you have no idea who it is.

Examples include a robot that needs a mechanic, a chronically ill person who needs a doctor's attention, or a god that requires devout prayer. Decide on the care you require and the skill needed to provide it. Possibilities include electronic maintenance (use Electronics Repair), mechanical maintenance (use Mechanic), medical care (use Physician), and physical repairs (use Carpentry, Electrician, etc.). You may specify an advantage or disadvantage instead; e.g., a god might require worshippers with Disciplines of Faith. You can split Maintenance between multiple skills; for instance, a robot might require Electronics Repair and Mechanic. Those who maintain you must have access to the appropriate facilities: a mechanic needs tools, worshippers must pray at a temple, etc. No resources are consumed, however; for that, take Dependency (p. 130). Each installment of maintenance takes one hour. The base point value depends on the number of people needed to perform it: Number of People   Point Value 1                  -10 2                  -20 3-5                -30 6-10               -40 11-20              -50 21-50              -60 51-100             -70  Add another -10 points per full doubling of the number of people required; e.g., a god that requires 10,000 worshippers would have a base-130-point disadvantage.

Failure results in some additional incapacity of the GM's choosing. Critical failure means a potentially fatal outcome; e.g., a human might suffer a heart attack, or a vehicle's brakes might fail while it is moving.

This trait is especially appropriate for crimefighters, supers, etc. -10 points. Cannot Kill: You may fight – you may even start fights – but you may never do anything that seems likely to kill another. This includes abandoning a wounded foe to die 'on his own'! You must do your best to keep your companions from killing, too. If you do kill someone (or feel responsible for a death), you immediately suffer a nervous breakdown. Roll 2d and be totally morose and useless (roleplay it!) for that many days. During this time, you must make a Will roll to offer any sort of violence toward anyone, for any reason. -15 points. Self-Defense Only: You only fight to defend yourself or those in your care, using only as much force as necessary (no pre-emptive strikes allowed!). You must do your best to discourage others from starting fights. -15 points. Total Nonviolence: You will not lift a hand against another intelligent creature, for any reason. You must do your nonviolent best to discourage violent behavior in others, too. You are free to defend yourself against attacks by animals, mosquitoes, etc.-30 points. In a high-realism campaign, the GM might require all PCs to start out with Reluctant Killer or even Cannot Kill, giving them extra points but putting them at a disadvantage when facing hardened foes.",

  "disadvantage-phobias-description": "You are afraid of a specific item, creature, or circumstance. Many fears are reasonable, but a Phobia is an unreasonable, unreasoning, morbid fear. The point value depends on how common the object of your fear is – fear of darkness is far more troublesome than fear of left-handed plumbers. Make a self-control roll whenever you are exposed to the object of your Phobia. If you fail, roll 2d, add the amount by which you failed your selfcontrol roll, and look up the result on the Fright Check Table (p. 260). For instance, if your self-control number is 9 but you rolled a 13, roll 2d+4 on the table. The result from the table affects you immediately! If you succeed, you have successfully mastered your Phobia (for now), but you are still shaken, and have a penalty to all DX, IQ, and skill rolls while the cause of your fear persists.

Even the mere threat of the feared object requires a self-control roll, although this is at +4. If your enemies actually inflict the feared object on you, you must make an unmodified self-control roll, as described above. If you fail, you might break down, depending on the Fright Check results, but you won't necessarily talk. Some people can panic and fall apart, but still refuse to talk – just as some people do not talk under torture. A phobic situation is by definition stressful. If you have other mental disadvantages that are triggered by stress, you are likely to have these reactions if you fail to resist a Phobia. Some common phobias: Being Alone (Autophobia): You cannot stand to be alone, and do anything in your power to avoid it. -15 points.* Blood (Hemophobia): The sight of blood gives you the screaming willies! You need to make a self-control roll during most combats ... -10 points.* Cats (Ailurophobia): -5 points.* Crowds (Demophobia): Any group of over a dozen people sets off this fear unless they are all well known to you. The self-control roll is at -1 for over 25 people, -2 for a crowd of 100 or more,-3 for 1,000, -4 for 10,000, and so on.-15 points.* Darkness (Scotophobia): A common fear, but crippling. You should avoid   being underground if possible; if something happens to your flashlight or torch, you might well lose your mind before you can relight it. -15 points.* Death and the Dead (Necrophobia): You are terrified by the idea of death. Make a self-control roll in the presence of any dead body (animals don't count, but portions of human bodies do). Roll at -4 if the body is that of someone you know, or -6 if the body is unnaturally animated in some way. A ghost (or apparent ghost) also requires a roll at -6. -10 points.* Dirt (Mysophobia): You are deathly afraid of infection, or just of dirt and filth. Make a self-control roll when you must do something that might get you dirty. Roll at -5 to eat any unaccustomed food. You should act as 'finicky' as possible. -10 points.* Dogs (Cynophobia): This includes all canines: foxes, wolves, coyotes, wild dogs, etc. -5 points.* Enclosed Spaces (Claustrophobia): A common, crippling fear. You are uncomfortable any time you can't see the sky – or at least a very high ceiling. In a small room or vehicle, you feel the walls closing in on you ... You need air! This is a dangerous fear for someone who plans to go underground. -15 points.*  Fire (Pyrophobia): Even a burning cigarette bothers you if it comes within five yards. -5 points.* Heights (Acrophobia): You may not voluntarily go more than 15 feet above ground, unless you are inside a building and away from windows. If there is some chance of an actual fall, selfcontrol rolls are at -5. -10 points.* Insects (Entomophobia): You are afraid of all 'bugs.' Large or poisonous ones give -3 to self-control rolls. Very large ones, or large numbers, give-6. Avoid hills of giant ants. -10 points.* Loud Noises (Brontophobia): You avoid any situation where loud noises are likely. A sudden loud noise requires an immediate self-control roll. A thunderstorm is a traumatic experience for you! -10 points.* Machinery (Technophobia): You can never learn to repair any sort of machine and refuse to learn to use anything more complicated than a crossbow or bicycle. Any highly technological environment calls for a selfcontrol roll; dealings with robots or computers require a roll at -3, and hostility from intelligent machines requires a roll at -6. -5 points at TL4 or below, -15 points at TL5 or above.* Magic (Manaphobia): You can never learn to use magic, and you react badly to any user of magic. Make a self-control roll whenever you are in the presence of magic. This roll is at -3 if you are to be the target of friendly magic, and -6 if you are the target of hostile magic. (The magic does not have to be real, if you believe in it!) -15 points in a setting where magic is common, -10 if it is known but uncommon,-5 if 'real' magic is essentially unknown.* Monsters (Teratophobia): Any 'unnatural' creature sets off this fear. You have -1 to -4 on the self-control roll if the monster seems very large or dangerous, or if there are a lot of them. Note that the definition of 'monster' depends on experience. An American Indian would consider an elephant monstrous, while an African pygmy would not! -15 points.* Number 13 (Triskaidekaphobia): You must make a self-control roll whenever you have to deal with the number 13 – visit the 13th floor, buy something for $13.00, etc. Roll at -5 if Friday the 13th is involved! -5 points.*  Oceans (Thalassophobia): You are afraid of any large body of water. Ocean travel, or even air travel over the ocean, is basically impossible for you, and encounters with aquatic monsters are also upsetting. -10 points.* Open Spaces (Agoraphobia): You are uncomfortable whenever you are outside, and actually become frightened when there are no walls within 50 feet. -10 points.* Psionic Powers (Psionophobia): You are afraid of those with known psionic powers. An actual exhibition of power in your presence requires a self-control roll. You do not voluntarily allow anyone to use a psionic power on you. The power does not have to be real – all that matters is that you believe it is! -15 points if psi powers are common, -10 if they are uncommon, -5 if they are essentially unknown.* Reptiles (Herpetophobia): You come unglued at the thought of reptiles, amphibians, and similar scaly slimies. A very large reptile, or a poisonous one, gives -2 to self-control rolls; a horde of reptiles (such as a snake pit) gives -4. -10 points.* Sex (Coitophobia): You are terrified by the idea of sexual relations or the loss of your virginity. -10 points Sharp Things (Aichmophobia): You are afraid of anything pointed. Swords, spears, knives, and hypodermic needles all give you fits. Trying to use a sharp weapon, or being threatened with one, requires a self-control roll at -2. -15 points at TL5 or below,-10 at TL6 or above.* Spiders (Arachnophobia): -5 points.* Strange and Unknown Things (Xenophobia): You are upset by any sort of strange circumstances, and in particular by strange people. Make a self-control roll when surrounded by people of another race or nationality; roll at -3 if the people are not human. If you lose control, you might well attack strangers out of fear. -15 points.* Sun (Heliophobia): -15 points.* Weapons (Hoplophobia): The presence of any sort of weaponry is stressful. Trying to use a weapon, or being threatened with one, requires a selfcontrol roll at -2. -20 points.",

Possible Death: Your Secret is so terrible that you might be executed by the authorities, lynched by a mob, or assassinated (by the Mafia, CIA, etc.) were it revealed. You would be a hunted man. -30 points.  Frequency of Appearance In general, a Secret appears in a particular game session if the GM rolls a 6 or less on 2d before the adventure begins. However, as for all other disadvantages of this type, the GM need not feel constrained by the appearance roll. If he thinks that the Secret should come into play, it does! When a Secret appears in play, it is not automatically made public. The GM will give you a chance to prevent your Secret from being revealed. This might require you to cave in to blackmail or extortion, steal incriminating documents, or even silence the person who knows the Secret. Regardless of the solution, however, it's only temporary – the Secret will appear again and again until either you buy it off with earned character points or it is finally revealed.  Effects of Revelation If a Secret is made public, there is an immediate negative effect ranging from serious embarrassment to possible death, depending on the severity of the Secret (see above). There is also a lasting effect: you suddenly acquire new, permanent disadvantages – or lose advantages – worth points equal to twice what the Secret was worth! These new disadvantages replace the Secret on your character sheet, and reduce your point value accordingly. The GM chooses the new disadvantages and lost advantages, which should always be appropriate to the Secret. Most Secrets turn into Enemies (p. 135), negative Reputations (p. 26), and Social Stigmas (p. 155), or reduce or remove advantages described under Wealth and Influence (pp. 25-30). Some could even turn into mental or physical disadvantages.   Example: A city guardsman has a -20-point Secret: at night, he is a thief. When he is finally caught and brought to justice, his Secret is revealed and immediately replaced with -40 points in disadvantages and lost advantages! The GM rules that he is stripped of his 5-point Legal Enforcement Powers (-5 points), gains Social Stigma (Criminal Record) (-5 points), and is punished by having his right hand chopped off (One Hand, -15 points) and being forced to pay reparations that reduce his Wealth from Average to Poor (-15 points).",

It is difficult (and often illegal) to maintain a Secret Identity. The GM will roll to see whether your Secret Identity factors into a game session, just as for any Secret. If it does, this usually takes the form of someone who threatens to expose your real identity. Anyone with Status 3 or higher gets an extra -10 points for a Secret Identity, because of the attention the media and public pay to his every move, but the GM will introduce a challenge to his identity on a roll of 7 or less instead of the usual 6 or less.

To be worth points, this must be obvious from your physical appearance (a visible brand, tattoo, or magical mark counts), dress, manner, or speech; or easily learned by anyone who cares to check up on you (only valid in societies with free and easy access to information); or the result of public denouncement (e.g., by a powerful leader or media figure) that ensures that everyone you meet knows that you, personally, belong to the disdained group. A Social Stigma gives you a reaction penalty (-1 per -5 points of Social Stigma), restricts your social mobility, or both. Examples include: Criminal Record: You have been convicted of a crime that your society considers serious. You may be prohibited from legally acquiring certain items (e.g., weapons), taking certain kinds of employment, receiving security clearances, or even traveling outside your country. Many noncriminals who learn of your past react at -1; police, judges, vigilantes, and other law-and-order types usually react at-2. If you are also wanted, take an appropriate Enemy. -5 points. Disowned: Your family has publicly snubbed you. This is only worth points in settings where family ties play a significant social role, and never applies to those who voluntarily part ways with their family. This Social Stigma comes in two levels: • You would normally be an heir in your culture, but someone else has been named in your stead. This is embarrassing, but you may still count yourself as part of the family. This gives -1 on reaction rolls. -5 points. • The head of your family – or your entire clan – has wholly and publicly disowned you. This gives -2 on reaction rolls. -10 points. Excommunicated: Your church has cast you out. Followers of your faith react to you at -3. This is only a disadvantage if you are excommunicated by a powerful and widespread religion (most likely state-backed) that plays a significant role in day-to-day life. -5 points. If your religion has true supernatural power, and you are surrounded by an aura that conveys your shame to co-religionists, angels, and anyone else who would care, no matter how well you disguise yourself, your Social Stigma is worth twice as much. -10 points.   Ignorant: You have not learned a skill required of all responsible adults in your society (that is, you have no points in the skill). Others look down upon you as a slacker or a fool. This gives -1 on reactions for each 'expected' skill you lack, up to a maximum of four skills. This is only worth points in highly structured societies, or in primitive ones where individuals depend on one another for survival. -5 points/skill. Minor: You are underage by your culture's standards. You suffer -2 on reaction rolls whenever you try to deal with others as an adult; they might like you, but they do not fully respect you. You might also be barred from nightclubs, vehicle operation, war parties, guild membership, etc., depending on the culture and setting. You must buy off this trait when you reach 'legal age' (usually 18) for your time and place. -5 points. Minority Group: You are a member of a minority that the dominant culture around you regards as 'barbarians' or 'inferior.' You get -2 on all reaction rolls made by anyone except your own kind. In an area, profession, or situation where your minority is especially rare, you get +2 on reaction rolls made by your own kind. -10 points. Monster: You are a large carnivore, magical abomination, or other being that is hated or feared regardless of actual appearance or disposition. This gives you -3 on all reaction rolls, and you are liable to be hunted on sight. However, you get +3 to Intimidation rolls in situations where you have the upper hand (GM's opinion). Examples: a bear or a vampire. -15 points. Second-Class Citizen: You belong to a group that receives fewer rights and privileges than 'full citizens.' This gives -1 on all reaction rolls except from others of your own kind. Examples: a woman in 19th-century America, or members of some religions. -5 points. Subjugated: You are a member of a slave nation or race. Within the overlords' culture, you have no rights, and suffer the negative effects of SecondClass Citizen and Valuable Property. If you manage to escape to freedom, you acquire the entire overlord nation or race as an Enemy. -20 points.  Uneducated: You are from a class, race, or subculture that lacks a cultural repository of wisdom, eschews formal schooling, and takes a dim view of activities that do not relate directly to survival or procreation. You receive -1 to reactions from more sophisticated folk in any situation where your lack of schooling would be apparent, and you may not start with any 'booklearned' skills (GM's discretion; most IQ/Hard skills qualify). You may buy off this trait once you have lived in 'civilized' parts for long enough (GM's decision). -5 points. Valuable Property: Your society regards you as somebody's property rather than as a 'legal person.' This takes the form of limited freedom or lack of intellectual respect more than as a reaction modifier. Examples: a woman in 18th-century America or 16th-century Japan. -10 points. Social Stigmas must bind those who take them. For example, a medieval Japanese lady must pay for her 10-point bonus by giving up her freedom of movement in many cases, and must defer to older male relatives when they are present. A black slave in 19th-century America is allowed to learn very little and own almost no property, and has little freedom of any kind unless he manages to escape. (If he does escape, he has traded his Social Stigma for a powerful Enemy!) It is possible to have multiple Social Stigmas, provided they do not significantly overlap (GM's decision).

'Bobby' is a party animal with -2 to Will [-10], Compulsive Carousing (6) [-10], and the quirk 'Sleeps all day and goes out at night' [-1].

Some examples:  Minor Vow: Silence during daylight hours; vegetarianism; chastity (yes, for game purposes, this is minor). -5 points. Major Vow: Use no edged weapons; keep silence at all times; never sleep indoors; own no more than your horse can carry. -10 points. Great Vow: Never refuse any request for aid; always fight with the wrong hand; hunt a given foe until you destroy him; challenge every knight you meet to combat. -15 points. Note that if you could represent your Vow using another disadvantage, you only get points for one of the two disadvantages (your choice). No one may get points for Vow (Poverty) and Wealth (Dead Broke), Vow (Never kill) and Pacifism (Cannot Kill), etc. Many Vows end after a specified period of time. You must buy off such a Vow when it ends. Vows for a period of less than a year are frivolous! If you want to end a Vow before its stated time, the GM may exact a penalty; for instance, in a medieval world, you might have to undertake a quest by way of penance.",

  "disadvantage-vulnerability": "Vulnerability",
  "disadvantage-vulnerability-type": "Physical; Exotic",
  "disadvantage-vulnerability-description": "You take extra damage from a particular attack form. Whenever this type of attack hits you, the GM applies a special wounding multiplier to damage that penetrates your DR. Regular wounding multipliers (for cutting, impaling, etc.) further multiply the damage. Example: A werewolf with Vulnerability (Silver x4) is nicked with a silver knife for 1 point of cutting damage. The GM multiplies this by 4 for Vulnerability, giving 4 points of damage, and then multiplies by 1.5 for a cutting attack. The final injury is 6 HP. Point value depends on the wounding multiplier and the rarity of the attack:  Vulnerability Table  Rarity of Attack        Wounding Multiplier                   x2            x3           x4 Rare              -10 points    -15 points   -20 points Occasional        -20 points    -30 points   -40 points Common            -30 points    -45 points   -60 points Very Common       -40 points    -60 points   -80 points  Use the categories under Limited Defenses (p. 46) to assess rarity. The GM has the final say on the rarity of a given attack form. You may not take more than two types of Vulnerability without GM permission. You cannot have Vulnerability to anything against which you have a specific defense: Resistant, Damage Resistance limited to work only against that attack form, etc. You can have both Vulnerability and Supernatural Durability (p. 89), but this reduces the utility of Supernatural Durability.  Special Limitations Fatigue Only: You are vulnerable to an attack that drains FP instead of HP, or to some form of mundane fatigue loss (e.g., x2 FP from hot weather).-50%.",

  "disadvantage-weakness-description": "You suffer injury merely by being in the presence of a particular substance or condition (which cannot be a food item or something equally easy to avoid). This injury comes off your HP directly, regardless of your DR or defensive advantages. The more quickly you take damage, the more points your Weakness is worth:  Frequency of Damage    Value 1d per minute          -20 points 1d per 5 minutes       -10 points 1d per 20 minutes      -5 points  Multiply the base value to reflect the rarity of the damaging substance or condition:  Rare (e.g., exotic radiation or minerals): x1/2. Occasional (e.g., microwave radiation, intense normal cold, airborne pollen): x1. Common (e.g., smoke, nearby magic, horses, loud noises): x2. Very Common (e.g., sunlight, living plants): x3. Example: An anaerobic organism takes 1d per minute from oxygen. The base value of a Weakness that inflicts 1d per minute is -20 points. Since oxygen is 'Very Common,' final cost is -60 points. You may not take more than two types of Weakness without GM permission.  Special Limitations Fatigue Only: Your Weakness drains FP instead of HP. -50%.Variable: Your Weakness is sensitive to received intensity. You may specify one relatively common class of barriers that halves the rate at which you take damage (e.g., heavy clothing or sunscreen, for sunlight). On the other hand, intense sources (GM's decision) double the rate at which you suffer harm! -40%.",

Such attacks have a wounding multiplier of 1.5 (that is, you take 50% more damage). Blood agents that reach your wound affect you as if carried on a weapon that broke your skin. You must carefully dress your wound each day (requires a First Aid or Physician roll) or get -3 to all HT rolls to resist infection in a plague-ridden area.
