Spider Silk takes triple damage from fire-based attacks. The caster may shoot as many strands as he has arms from a single casting of Spider Silk; however, the cost to cast is based on the total length of all strands created. Thus, a many-armed spider demon can throw half a dozen strands at once, but it won't be cheap. Strands of Spider Silk may also be used to build a web by anchoring successive strands between two surfaces.

The caster may only learn the form of an animal with which he is familiar. Many worlds have only a limited number of animal forms available. Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the beastform is taken and reappear when the human form is resumed (magical jewelry cannot be detected while 'vanished'). Backpacks, carried items, etc., simply fall to the ground. The caster retains his intelligence, but gains all the physical attributes of the new form. This means that the wearer cannot cast spells unless he knows them so well that they can be performed without gestures! Note that Fatigue Points are not increased for spellcasting purposes. Each hour that the spell continues, the caster must make a roll against IQ; failure means that the caster loses a point of IQ, continuing until the normal IQ of that beast is reached. Should the caster's IQ drop to 5, he is trapped in beast form forever unless the spell is removed by Remove Curse (other spells won't counter it). Lost IQ is regained when human form is reassumed. For most natural beast forms, an energy cost of 6 to cast and 2 to maintain is appropriate; animals with great strength, for example, tend to be counterbalanced by reduced agility. If the GM allows supernatural creatures as beast forms, however, or if he is concerned about the power of a given animal form, he may wish to change the cost of the spell. A reasonable guideline is to calculate the point value of the physical characteristics of the beast form and charge 1/20 of the form's cost to cast and 1/60 to maintain, with a minimum cost of 3 to cast and 1 to maintain.",

The subject acquires Colorblindness as a side effect. Scorpion Tail (7 to cast): The subject grows a scorpion's stinger, complete with poison gland. This is an Impaling Striker (p. B88) with the Follow-Up enhancement; on a successful penetrating hit, a 1d+2 Innate Attack (Toxic, Melee Attack, Resistible) takes effect.

Skunk Tail (3 to cast): The subject grows a huge skunk's tail (2 yards long), and gains the ability to use the Stench spell (p. 24) at will. The area of effect is two yards in radius and must be centered on some portion of the tail. This ability costs 2 FP to use.

Once the spell is cast, the area to be transported vanishes (see below), replaced by bare earth or open water. The caster is now 'carrying' that area in invisible, intangible form (this fact can be determined by Detect Magic or something similar). Beings caught in the affected area have a resistance roll based on the best Will among them, modified by -1 for every additional yard of radius of the subject area (thus, Move Terrain with a 2-yard radius is resisted by Will-1). Successful resistance negates the spell. Once the casting is successfully completed, the subject area 'shrinks' in radius at the rate of 1 yard per second, moving toward the caster at the same rate. Victims quick enough on their feet should be able to jump out of the area as it shrinks (this has good dramatic potential) – make DX and IQ rolls! GMs may decide this warrants a Fright Check. Beings caught by the spell are aware of a wild, swirling sky above their heads and a physically impenetrable barrier all around them. The atmosphere inside remains breathable and comfortable (so this spell cannot be used to suffocate someone!). Spells cast out of the area automatically hit the Move Terrain's holder – thus, a trapped mage could walk up to the affected area's edge, lay his hand against the barrier, and cast Deathtouch at the holder! Captive mages could also cast Dispel Magic or Counterspell on the affected area, forcing the spell to end abruptly if they are successful. When the caster stops maintaining the spell, the terrain reappears. The caster's location falls anywhere within it or at its edge. The subject area 'expands' back to normal size at the same rate it shrank. If there is no suitable space available, anything in the way is moved aside as if by Shape Earth. The caster may not use this spell again for one full day. The subject area or any part of it cannot be moved again by this spell (from any caster or magic item) for the same period. Cast over a large enough area, this spell can place mountains in the middle of plains, open water (as deep as half the radius of effect, transported from lake or ocean) in the midst of a desert – or shift islands miles inland to form hills!",

An item with only a single use can be created for 15% of the normal energy, two uses would cost 30%, four would cost 60% (very costineffective under most circumstances) and the cost for an item limited to 7 or more uses actually exceeds the cost of a permanent item. The temporarily enchanted item acts, in all respects, as a normal item of that type until all of its uses are consumed. Once all the uses of the temporary item are gone, the item is no longer magical. The Temporary Enchantment spell is used in place of the Enchant spell. A single item may not be enchanted with both temporary and permanent spells simultaneously. Temporary Enchantment can only be used to give items a one-time ability to cast a certain spell – not to cast the spell on the object. For example, a mage couldn't make a one-shot set of invisible armor – it would never wear off. He could give the armor the ability to cast the Invisibility spell on itself at normal energy and duration costs. Temporary Enchantment cannot be used in conjunction with any Enchantment college or Meta-Spell college spells except the following: Hex, Limit, Link, Name, Power, and Speed.

In that case, roll using the skill level of the mage who wrote the scroll. Pronunciation is important when reading a scroll aloud! If the mage reading the scroll has Accented spoken comprehension of the scroll's language, the scroll casts its spell at a -1 penalty; if he has Broken spoken comprehension, the scroll casts at -3. If he has None, he cannot articulate the words properly and cannot cast the spell. A scroll can be read silently, to see what it says.

There is no other way to repair a golem. To create a golem, the creator must make its body – doing all the work himself – then animate it with this spell. Once animated, a golem lasts until reduced to 0 HP or until its creator commands it to cease functioning. No concentration or maintenance is required to control a golem. A basic clay golem (see box) costs 250 energy to enchant. A more powerful golem costs an additional 2 energy for every extra character point of abilities added to the golem. In most cases, additional abilities should be restricted to extra ST, HP, and DR (a rule of thumb: 20 points of energy buys 1 ST, 5 HP, or 2 DR); however, GMs may allow more sweeping changes to the basic golem if they feel comfortable doing so. More powerful golems may require more durable (and more costly) materials, adding to the cost and time required to create the golem's body. (Optionally, the GM may allow less powerful golems; golems worth less than 0 points cost 2 less energy for every character point below zero, to a minimum of 130 energy.)",

  "spell-impression-blocker-description": "Seeker (p. 105) and related spells require an object associated with the item or person sought in order to work. The Impression Blocker Enchantment creates a container that allows people to carry items without them becoming 'associated' with the carrier. An object in a closed blocker container retains the impressions it had when the container was shut. If removed, handled briefly, and replaced, the object will acquire a very faint impression of the handler, but it won't be enough for a Seeker spell unless the handler does so once a day for decades. It is possible for an object in a blocker container still to be useful; for example, a book open to an important page, and stored in a glass container, can still be read! At sufficiently advanced tech levels, a 'waldo' or remote-manipulation box can be enchanted, allowing handling of the object without opening the box. In some settings, these containers can also be used to preserve evidence. If an object is owned for one person for a long time, and then transferred to a new owner, the original owner's impressions may wear off. A blocker container preserves the original owner's impressions. (In other settings, impressions never wear off; they just accumulate, so an item can be used to cast Seeker on any previous owner.)",

  "spell-malefice-type": "Enchantment",
  "spell-malefice-description": "Through this foul enchantment, the caster can put a victim under his thrall. He must fashion a doll (usually out of wax, but clay, straw, and other materials may be appropriate with the GM's permission) with something personally relevant to the target imbedded in it. Parts of the body (nail clippings, hair, blood, spittle, etc.) allow a casting at base skill. Other items allow a casting at a varying penalty; for example, threads from a shirt worn for years might be worth -2, while dirt from a fresh footprint might be worth -6. Malefice is a lasting spell (p. 10) that continues until its Endurance is reduced to 0. It starts with an Endurance equal to its caster's effective skill. The doll can be used by its maker (and no one else) to cast harmful spells (such as Pain) on the target, at normal energy cost, while ignoring distance penalties. The caster uses the lower of the Malefice's Endurance and his skill with the channeled spell. The target resists all such attacks, even if the spell is normally not Resisted (spells without normal resistance rules are Resisted by HT when cast through a Malefice doll). If the victim resists the very first spell cast upon him through the doll, the enchantment is immediately broken. Otherwise, every successful resistance simply weakens the Malefice, reducing its Endurance by 1. Upon reaching Endurance 0, the Malefice dissipates (though the doll is still a viable item for re-enchantment, and its magical association with the target offsets one point of casting penalty). A critical failure by the channeled spell or a critical success by the subject also breaks the enchantment, reducing the doll's Endurance to zero. Destroying the doll breaks the spell, but it also inflicts on the target a Deathtouch (p. 41) of as many dice as the Malefice's current Endurance divided by 5 (round down, maximum of 3d). This damage occurs as long as the Malefice has any Endurance remaining. Remove Curse frees the target from the Malefice without harm to him.",

  "spell-ensorcel-description": "An ensorcelment is a durable spell, usually malign but sometimes beneficial, cast on a single being. The process requires something that is personally relevant to the subject; use the modifiers listed under Malefice. The caster's spell roll is determined by the lower of his skills with this spell and the specific spell being placed on the subject. If the caster has assistants, their skills with both spells must be 15 or greater, but the roll is based on the caster's skill. Possible ensorcelments include quite a few Body or Mind Control spells and others such as Shapeshift Other, Flesh to Stone, the various 'Body of' spells, Walk on Air, the various 'Resist' spells, Hide, Invisibility, the various 'Vision' spells and Plant Form Other. In all cases, it must be a maintainable Regular spell. When the spell is cast, the subject gets a resistance roll if the object spell allows one; distance is not a factor. Remove Curse is effective against any ensorcelment. The cost of the enchantment can be reduced if the caster includes an 'escape clause' – a particular action or condition that will break the spell. Examples include speaking a magic word, being kissed as a gesture of true love, abstaining from speech for three years, and so on. The value of the energy reduction depends on just how difficult the condition will be to meet – and the 'escape clause' must be at least possible to be worth any reduction. The 'discount' can be anything from 10% (for truly difficult or unlikely conditions) to 90% (for something that the subject could easily and automatically do, and easily discover).",

The stone's user concentrates for a second while crushing the spell stone in his hand, thus casting the spell. At the beginning of his next turn, roll against the spell stone's Power. If the roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it is failed, the stone is simply wasted. If the stone is crushed without the requisite second of concentration, it is likewise wasted. The spell's energy is included in the enchantment; none is required of the user, who also may not opt to supply any power to maintain the spell. Likewise, he may not cancel the spell once cast, although the creator of the stone may specify a shorter duration than ordinary and may also invest extra energy into the enchantment so that the spell will maintain itself. A person may use only one spell stone per second. A spell stone must be made from a jewel worth $10xP2 + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the spell that may be contained. Any spell except a Blocking or Enchantment spell may be stored in a spell stone. Limiting Enchantments may be put on the stone. If the spell stored in the stone requires that the caster know another spell (Counterspell, for instance), that other spell must be specified at creation time. It is thus possible to create a spell stone that will counter one specific spell, but it is impossible to create a generic Counterspell spell stone. It is also possible to create spell stones which, when crushed, do not cast the spell for the user, but on him!

The simulacrum, once enchanted, appears identical to the target (including such details as eye color and skin tone) through a sort of always-on Perfect Illusion Disguise. The simulacrum has the same attributes as the underlying golem. Golems intended as simulacra are often designed with higher IQ than ordinary golems, to improve the deception. Once the simulacrum is activated, it takes on the persona and knowledge of the target, as the caster perceives them. That is, the Simulacrum cannot know something that the target does if the caster didn't. IQ rolls may be required of the caster as challenges come up (what was the name of his great-uncle, anyway?).

It gets its knowledge from the embedded object; anything that the History spell could divine, it will know. It acts as the original would, had the Doppelgänger's creator enslaved him. Suspend Curse paralyzes it, and Remove Curse destroys it. When destroyed, all that is left is a mass of the original material (a puddle of water, a mound of earth, a sudden rush of flames) and the personal possession. It is very difficult to detect the trickery. Whenever the GM judges an Information spell does not altogether fail to tell the copy from the original, he should let the Doppelgänger spell resist.

If the spell is a 'continuing' one, it is up to the GM to determine how long it should last. (2) It can permanently improve a character's scores.

If the arrow is fired without the required concentration, the spell is wasted, but the arrow still does normal damage. The spell's energy is included in the enchantment. The archer need not (and cannot) provide any to cast the spell or maintain it. Similarly, the archer may not cancel the spell once cast, though the enchanter may speci- fy a shorter duration than normal, and may also invest extra energy so the spell will maintain itself. The head of a spell arrow must contain a jewel worth $10xP2 + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the contained spell. The gem is destroyed when the spell activates. (The rest of the arrow may be recoverable, but is now nonmagical.) Any spell that can be enchanted into a magic item can be placed in a spell arrow, except for Blocking spells, Enchantment spells, Melee spells, or spells whose magic item description specifies 'must touch.' Note that some permissible spells are pointless (e.g., Beast-Soother), since the archer must hit the target with an arrow any- way. Enchantments may be placed on the arrow itself normally, including limiting enchantments. The only decision the archer can make is what he's aiming at. If the spell requires a subject, whatever the arrow hits is the subject. (If it is not a legal subject – e.g., a wooden wall for Strike Blind – the spell is wasted.) What constitutes a 'solid object' may require the GM's judgment (for exam- ple, drops of rain are not enough to trigger the spell). If it is an Area spell, the point of impact is the center of the area. If it is a Missile spell, the effect is as if the missile hit the target, in addi- tion to the arrow (the missile does not launch itself from the point of impact). If the spell creates an object, the object appears as close as possible to the point of impact. If the spell would normally affect both a subject and the caster (e.g., (Animal) Control) the archer is treated as the caster. If the spell requires a human target, the spell still works even if the arrow hits clothing instead of skin.

The shield has Shield-16, Basic Speed 5, and ST equal to the Power of the enchant- ment (for bashing purposes). It follows its owner's mental or spoken instructions as to which side to guard. If the owner is knocked out, the shield continues protecting him to the best of its abilities. If the owner dies, the shield falls to the ground. The shield can Block two different attacks per turn, regardless of its owner's actions (so the owner could parry any blow that got by the shield, for instance). The shield can be instructed to bash (p. B406), in which case its owner forfeits the shield's pro- tection until the beginning of his next turn (the shield will travel no more than two yards from the owner to bash). The shield can be attacked at a penalty of its DB-4. The shield's defense will be either a Block (using Shield/2) or a Dodge (using Speed); it does not get any DB bonus from itself. The shield could also be netted or bagged (standard to-hit roll). If the shield gets a critical miss or is struck by a critical hit, it is stunned and out of the fight until its owner grasps it and 'wakes it up' (a Ready maneu- ver). The shield loses its magic if destroyed; if penetrated by an impal- ing or piercing weapon, it loses one point each of Power, Shield skill, and Basic Speed.

  "spell-powerstone-type": "Enchantment",
  "spell-powerstone-description": "Infuses mana into an object for later use by a wizard. Traditionally, a gemstone serves as the subject of this spell (for this reason, 'Powerstone' is the generic word for an object containing stored mana), but any object can potentially be used. Any wizard touching a Powerstone may take any or all of the energy it contains, using it instead of his body's own energy to cast a spell. Each Powerstone is said to have a 'capacity.' This is the maximum amount of energy it can hold. Since a wizard can only use one Powerstone at a time, a large Powerstone is more useful than a handful of small ones. A large Powerstone can be used to cast a large spell; a group of small ones can be used one at a time to help maintain a spell, but cannot be used all at once. A Powerstone 'recharges' itself after use, by absorbing mana from the surrounding area. The rate of recharge varies with the area's mana level.  Local Mana None Low Normal High Very High  Recharge Rate None 1 point/week 1 point/day 1 point/12 hours 1 point/6 hours  A Powerstone does not recharge if it is within six feet of a larger Powerstone. Stones of the same size split the available mana and recharge at slower speed. This unfortunate fact means that the owner of several Powerstones must let some of them out of his sight to get them recharged! A Powerstone is enchanted one step at a time. The first time Powerstone is cast on an object, it becomes an uncharged Powerstone with capacity 1. Each additional casting increases its capacity by 1. Thus, 15 castings would create a Powerstone with a capacity of 15. But note that with this many castings, there would be a cumulative chance of nearly 1 in 4 that a critical failure would be rolled at some point, destroying the stone. For 60 successive castings, the cumulative chance of critical failure is 2 in 3! Further, each ordinary failure while casting puts some sort of magical 'quirk' on the stone. Thus, it is possible for work for months and end up with a 20-energy Powerstone that smells like fish and can only be used on Wednesdays ... This makes big stones without serious flaws more valuable than others of the same strength. The quirks of a Powerstone are set by the GM, and can be used as a tool for campaign balance. Most of them will be peculiar, arbitrary limitations on how the stone can recharge (e.g., only while bathed in bat blood) or how it can be used (e.g., only on Fire spells; only by a green-eyed virgin; not by anyone wearing a hat). A severe quirk affects the user of the stone (e.g., renders him mute for an hour). The caster knows if his spell has failed, but not what quirk his Powerstone now has. The Analyze Magic spell can determine what quirks a Powerstone has. Two failures in a row indicate that no further growth is possible for that stone. Any object may be used to produce a Powerstone. However, it is easier to enchant a Powerstone using an item with intrinsic value. The cost to cast Powerstone is quadrupled if the item being enchanted has a value of less than $10*P + $40*P, where P is the target capacity of the Powerstone. This is one reason gemstones are popular; a valuable stone is compact and durable.  A Powerstone is uncharged when created (though if it already contained energy, that energy is unaffected by a casting to increase its capacity). The energy from a Powerstone cannot be used for further enchantments on that stone – a Powerstone cannot be used to help enchant itself! Energy cost for each casting: 20.",

It must be kept inside a glass bottle and fed at least 1 HP worth of human blood each day to remain alive. If the bottle is broken or submitted to intense heat or light, the homunculus dies. Whenever he wishes, the caster can move his spirit into the homunculus, no matter how far away it is (as per Possession, p. 49), at an energy cost of 4 for the first minute and 2 for every minute thereafter. He may then observe and communicate with anyone in the homunculus' presence. Although the caster can cast spells from the homunculus (using his own energy), he cannot perform any physical action, since the homunculus is trapped inside the bottle. The caster may return to his original body at will. If a hostile wizard gains possession of a live homunculus, he can cast Communication and Empathy spells at the homunculus' creator at no range penalty! The creator also resists any such spells at -5 when cast through the homunculus. A homunculus is thus a great vulnerability and is only entrusted to the most faithful of servants. The caster may own several homunculi; he can move his spirit to only one at a time. While thus 'away,' the caster's body is very vulnerable and should be safeguarded.",

  "spell-effigy-type": "Enchantment",
  "spell-effigy-description": "A mage can enchant an effigy, a lifesize statue of himself, which attracts hostile magic directed at him to itself. Like Malefice, Effigy is a lasting spell, which continues until its Endurance is reduced to zero. Every time a spell attacks the effigy's maker, the effigy resists with its current Endurance, modified for the distance separating it from him (use the long-distance modifiers, p. 14). If the effigy succeeds, the spell affects it rather than its maker, The GM must decide what constitutes a 'hostile' spell; for instance, Deathtouch is, but Mind-Reading isn't. Redirected spells that have no effect on inanimate statues (such as Paralyze Limb or Death Vision) instead 'attack' the enchantment. The effigy then resists with its current Endurance. Every such successful attack reduces the effigy's Endurance by one; when the effigy's Endurance drops below 0, it ceases functioning. A critical failure by the effigy or a critical success by the attacking spell also breaks the enchantment, as does physical destruction. An enchanter may only have one effigy at any one time.",

He automatically makes all HT 'death checks' caused by injury. He may still fall unconscious. If the soul stone is destroyed, the caster dies, so it is usually hidden in a very hard-to-reach place. Death may also come from some magical causes, such as a Planar Visit failure. Note that the stone need not literally be a piece of rock; examples from folklore and fiction include the caster's own heart (removed once the spell is cast, presumably!), eggs, and more.

The more 'distant' the target time is, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty (see Time modifiers, box). Unlike Teleport, there is no penalty to timeport to an 'unfamiliar' time; the GM may, however, decree that any timeport to the future bears an extra penalty (-2, perhaps). If this spell takes the caster to the future, it is the most likely of many possible futures. If he returns from that future and acts on the information gained, there is no guarantee that the future he visited will actually occur. Similarly, a caster who returns to the past, changes something, and then returns to his starting time might return to an alternate timeline. The amount of variation between the caster's 'home' timeline and the new one will depend on the GMs view of how 'tamper-resistant' the timestream is in his game world(s). This spell is dangerous – the penalties for a failed roll are the same as for Teleport, substituting time for space. Also as in Teleport, the caster can carry no more than Heavy encumbrance (objects and beings). Roll vs. Body Sense skill upon arrival, modifying the roll for changes in velocity, facing, and orientation. If the caster wishes to travel simultaneously in both time and space, use the caster's Teleport or Timeport skill (whichever is lowest), and combine the penalties and costs for distance and time.

He is totally insubstantial and cannot affect anything or interact with his surroundings in any way (a blessing in disguise, since this also confers total physical immunity to whatever environment he is traversing). He cannot even cast spells, although he can maintain existing ones. He is likewise immune to magic that does not affect minds or spirits (which the caster is, until he returns to his body). The caster is imperceptible to ordinary senses; only magic (Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense Observation and similar spells) will detect his presence. There is a different spell for travel to each plane or dimension. Which spells exist, and the precise details of the dimensions they lead to, is up to the GM. The subject's senses are altered to correspond to the average plane dweller's; on a plane of perpetual gloom he would have Dark Vision, on the astral plane he would have his senses augmented as per Astral Vision, and on a dimension where all life forms sense only via sound he would have Scanning Sense (Sonar). Visiting very strange alternate planes can be hazardous to the mental health of an unsuspecting traveler ... The most common plane visited in most worlds is the astral, which coexists with the mundane universe and allows visitors to observe real-world places unseen (at least, unseen except by natives of the astral realm, if there are any). While traveling astrally, the caster moves at twice his full unencumbered Speed and may walk through walls, mountains, creatures ... He may also walk down into the bowels of the earth or up into the higher atmosphere. Astral Block (p. 159), Pentagram (p. 124) and the 'Utter' spells (p. 170) stop him, while Repel Spirits (p. 158) will resist his intrusion. If the spell ends before his spirit rejoins his body or if his body is harmed while his spirit is away, he must roll vs. HT, using the long-distance modifiers (p. 14), to stay alive!

  "spell-divert-teleport-description": "When cast on the turn someone or something teleports, timeports, or plane-shifts out, this spell allows the caster to dictate where or when the subject goes. The caster must know the spell he is diverting; he uses the lower of his skill with Divert Teleport and the subject spell. If the caster wants to divert a Teleport into a plane shift (for example), he must know both spells and uses the lowest of his three skills. The resistance is resolved by comparing the margins of success of both spells – if the mage who is teleporting makes his roll by 5, then the mage attempting to divert him must make his roll by 6 or more to succeed. The Divert Teleport takes normal range penalties between the caster of Divert Teleport and the caster of Teleport (or Timeport, etc.), and the standard skill penalty for the destination that the caster wishes to send the teleporter to. The cost to cast the spell is equal to the difference in cost between the teleporter's intended destination and his new destination. If a mage attempts to teleport 40 miles (9 energy), and another mage forces him to another location only 10 yards away (3 energy), the diverting mage will have to pay 6 energy. The same cost would apply if the destinations were reversed. The minimum cost to cast is 3, in any case (high skill will reduce this normally), and the caster pays the full energy cost whether or not the spell succeeds. Example: Suppose Severin knows Teleport at 16 and attempts to teleport 100 yards away to his waiting carriage (skill penalty -2, cost 4). Two yards away stands Elsdon, who knows Divert Teleport at 18 and Teleport at 20, and who would prefer that Severin end up just above a lake which happens to be a mile away (skill penalty -4, cost 7). First, Severin makes his attempt, spending 4 energy and rolling a 10. Since he needed a 14 or less, this is success by 4. Elsdon, using a base skill of 18 (the lowest of his appropriate spells), takes a -2 for being two yards away from Severin, and a further -4 for his intended diversion – his effective skill is 12. He must roll a 7 (succeeding by 5), to win the contest and divert Severin. Whether he does so or not, the calculated cost is 3 energy, so Elsdon must pay the minimum cost of 3.",

The more 'distance' between the gate and its destination, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty. To determine the skill penalty, combine the penalties for the equivalent Teleport, Timeport, or Plane Shift spell(s). To determine the energy cost, combine the energy costs from the same spell(s), and multiply the cost by 10. This cost will permit the caster to create a gate of any size up to a 3' x 6' doorway (or equivalent surface area). Larger gates are no more difficult, but cost proportionately more energy. This spell may also be used to enchant a permanent gate, in which case a few more considerations become important. The caster(s) must specify if it will be always open, always closed, or open and closed when certain conditions are fulfilled (opens only on the hour of the full moon, opens only when someone utters a password, etc). Several gates may share a single location. Only one of them may be open at any time, so it is common to have them cycle in time, giving the net effect of a single gate leading to a choice of destinations. They must be created separately, but otherwise behave as a single gate. Permanent gates can be 'anchored' to a physical gateway; they then resist displacement or destruction at a bonus given by the gateway's DR. When a gate has a Timeport component, the creator must specify if the gate merely displaces its users in time by a fixed amount (1 year into the past, for example) or if it sends its users to a specific, unchanging point in time (December 25, 1066, say). In the latter case, since subjects that step into the gate at various departure times can't all arrive at the same time, the gate either 'drifts' slowly in time so as to space the arrivals at least a second apart, or the various subjects arrive in different 'pasts' (GM's decision).",

  "spell-sanctuary-description": "Opens a door-sized portal to a pocket dimension. The portal closes immediately after the caster passes through it (others may pass through it first, of course). The portal leads to a small dimly lit room with blank walls and no visible exits. When the caster wishes to leave, he simply concentrates and a portal appears on one of the walls, leading back to his original point of departure. The space can have a size up to that of a cube equal to the caster's skill, in yards, on a side. The real world completely loses touch with the occupants of the pocket dimension; Seeker won't find them, Trace will lose them for the duration (but will pick them up as soon as they step back out) and so on. Of course, the reverse is also true.  Long-term visits to the pocket dimension will require the creation of air, food, and water (and decent lighting, for comfort's sake), as well as the disposal of wastes. This is slightly complicated by the fact that the pocket dimension is low-mana; all spellcasting is at -5, and the Recover Energy spell doesn't work. Should the spell expire or the caster lose consciousness, all the room's contents reappear as if teleported; its occupants each take 1d of damage and are physically stunned if they fail a Body Sense roll. This also happens to anyone who is foolish enough not to exit before the caster! If the caster wishes to return to the real world, but not to his point of departure, he may cast an appropriate magical transport spell from the pocket dimension as if he were casting it from the departure point (if he is willing to take the risk of a lowmana casting). Note: This 'default' description of the pocket universe created by this spell should by no means be taken as gospel. A less bare-bones version might include opulent (but magical and temporary) furnishings and features, illusionary windows, and so on. In some worlds, this will be determined by the GM's views on alternate dimensions. In others, the details of sanctuary dimensions might be conscious, or unconscious, reflections of the mage's personality.",

Should the caster die alone in the area, the spell will never end! The caster and any objects caught in the area would simply seem to vanish from the time stream. As far as outside observers are con- cerned, the area 'ages' instantaneously (which may or may not be perceptible). One moment five ogres were attacking the party while their wizard cast a spell, and the next moment the ogres were dead, the party magically healed, and everybody was in a different position and drinking rum to celebrate. From the inside, the area is bounded by a wall (and covered by a ceiling) of utter blackness. Anyone or anything touching the edge of the area is immediately expelled from the area, back into normal time. This causes an automatic mental stun to anyone other than the caster. Missiles of any sort can be thrown blindly out of the area (see Shooting Blind, p. B389) but not into it. Note that, since all missiles fired out of the area will emerge at the same outside time, an archer could create an impressive burst of arrows by simply firing casually for a few subjective hours ... Spells involving the outside simply fail. Any spell requiring concentration and lying inside the area lapses immediately if its caster is left outside. Likewise, any inside spell whose maintenance comes due during the Time Out lapses unless its caster is also inside.  The 'flow' of mana into the Timed Out area is effectively nil. Powerstones won't recharge, enchantment is impossible, etc. Mages still recover lost energy (the physical consequences of manipulating mana go away regardless of the local mana supply), but GMs may decree that spells cost much more, or are impossible, within the timestopped area (since the power must be drawn entirely from the caster's personal life-force).

  "spell-initiative-type": "Area",
  "spell-initiative-description": "This spell can be cast on any creation or illusion the caster controls, giving it a semblance of intelligence in order to act on its own initiative. The subject is totally loyal to the caster, and obeys him (or anyone else the caster orders it to heed) to the best of its ability. The base cost of the spell is based on what knowledge the caster grants the subject. Creations start with their own DX and IQ as listed in the spell description. For the purposes of this spell, Illusions and Phantoms start with IQ 0 and DX 8. The subject's DX and IQ may be raised as high as the caster's. The subject may also be given the caster's skills – every skill granted is known at the same relative level as the caster. Illusions and creations with Initiative may use defaults on any skill. Once the spell is cast, the subject acts on its own until the spell expires. If the subject comes across a situation that confuses it, it attempts to return to the caster for clarification. Like Independence (p. 96), this spell does not count as a spell 'on,' and does not require separate maintenance.  Example: Lady Ann Goulding has created a magical servant to amuse her noble and decadent guests. She wishes it to circulate throughout the party, serving food, dancing with the noblewomen, and showing appropriate respect – without requiring constant supervision, so that she can enjoy herself. It begins with 9 in every attribute, but no skills (Lady Ann could have created a skilled servitor, but she has Create Servant-15 and can maintain an unskilled one indefinitely). To this base she adds 2 points of DX (bringing it up to her own DX of 11), and 2 points of IQ (well below her own IQ of 14) to make it wittier. This is a total attribute increase of 4, for a base cost of 2. Lady Ann then gives it two skills – Dancing and Savoir-Faire. She has Dancing-14 (DX+3), and since the servant has the same DX as she does, the servant will, too. The lady's knowledge of Savoir-Faire is considerable (skill 15, or IQ+1), but the servant is not as smart as she, and will only have it at its own IQ+1, for a net Savoir-Faire13. These two skills add 2 more to the base cost, for a total of 4. Since the servant is less than 1 yard in radius, a casting at base cost will suffice.",

The magical duplicate follows all normal rules for items made with Create Object – it must remain in contact with a living thing, for instance, or it will disappear. The mage may also attempt to alter the creation. For instance, he could copy a sword and add inscribed runes, or forge a passport with a different name or picture, etc. In this case, normal rules for the caster's abilities apply; Forgery skill rolls may be required.

Alternatively, it may grope its way along walls, floors, and ceilings at a Move of 3. Concentration is necessary to move the hand, but not to hold or feel through it. The hand may not cast or deliver spells! Any touch-enhancing spells affecting the caster will also be usable through the hand. While feeling through the hand, the wizard's own hands are insensitive. Every turn, he must specify whether he is feeling through the Hand or through his own hands. The Hand is small, with a SM of -5, but any hit with a physical attack or any spell that could reasonably incapacitate it will destroy it.

The light burns like laser light and does burning damage. Increase a shield's DB against this spell by 50%, rounding down, if it is highly polished. Whether or not damage gets through armor, a hit to the face blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll. A hit to the eyes does double damage and blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll at a penalty equal to the damage suffered. Treat Sunboltinduced blindness as a crippling injury for recovery purposes (p. B420). Any mirror will reflect a Sunbolt; if the GM is uncertain of the exact angle of incidence/reflection (if the Sunbolt hits a hand-held mirror, for instance), determine its new direction randomly. Use the rules for hitting the wrong target (p. B389) to determine if anything along the new path is hit. Deliberately reflected shots are a much trickier matter; range penalties will be for the total range to the target, with an additional -2 for each 'bounce.' And unless the mirrors are very large and/or stable and/or deliberately placed for the purpose, the GM may simply declare the shot impossible. Defending characters holding mirrors may attempt to reflect the bolt back at the caster – treat this as a Block defense at a -2 penalty; also apply the normal range penalties from the defender to the caster. The DB of the mirror (if it is large enough to offer any; GM call) adds to this roll normally. The caster may defend normally, unless totally surprised. Sunbolt is not affected by Missile Shield or Reverse Missiles. Force Dome and Deflect Energy do offer protection. Areas of magical Darkness or Blackout resist Sunbolt.",

This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires; if complex, it should be put in writing. The triggering event must be something that could reasonably be determined by a normal person at the Delay site; the GM's decision is final. If the Delay is to be triggered by a more esoteric event, an appropriate spell such as Mage Sight may be cast on the Delay. The Delay may also be triggered by the activation of another spell, such as Watchdog or another linked spell. A Delay can activate only one other spell. The spells are cast one after the other, with no delays between spells. The Delay must be cast first, and counts as a spell 'on' when determining the skill level of the linked spell – see p. 10. Full cost for the linked spell and for the Delay must be paid at the time of casting. If the caster specifies a spell to affect a human-sized subject, and a larger victim (requiring more energy – see p. 11) actually triggers the Delay, there is either no effect or reduced effect, depending on the spell. The GM's ruling on this is final. Delay may be cast two ways: to activate the linked spell on a specific subject, or as a trap, to activate the linked spell against any subject that meets the triggering conditions. In the latter case, the Delay and the linked spell are both cast on a 'trap item,' and range is figured from the trap item at the moment the spell is triggered. Magic Resistance penalties also apply to the linked spell at the time of triggering. The caster rolls for Delay when it is first cast; the roll for the linked spell is not made until the triggering event occurs. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11. So, for instance, the dreaded 'deathtouch doorknob,' set to 'attack' the first person to touch it, would activate at a -5 penalty. When a Delay is triggered, the linked spell begins to activate, taking effect the next turn. Thus, a Delay cannot be used as a Blocking spell. It can be used as a trap; the victim may be taken by surprise. An unsuspecting victim must make an IQ roll to respond before the linked spell is fully activated – Combat Reflexes gives +6 to this roll. Both the Delay and the linked spell count as 'on' for spellcasting purposes; if an Information spell has been added, it is also on. The linked spell does not need to be maintained, though the Delay or its Information spell may need to be. Once the Delay is triggered, it vanishes, and no longer counts as on. The linked spell continues to count as on as long as it is active. It may be maintained normally. A Delay may also be set to 'turn off' an ongoing spell when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell lasts only while the caster maintains it, but the Delay itself requires no maintenance. Blocking and Missile spells cannot be Delayed – all other spells can. An 'instantaneous' spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires.",

This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires, and is governed like Delay (above). The Link may also be triggered by the activation of a spell placed on the area after the Link, such as Watchdog, Delay or another Link. The caster pays the energy costs and makes the skill rolls for the Link spell and all linked spells at the time of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high skill. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Link) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see p. 11. The size of the area of the Link spell is determined at the time of casting. Any linked spells may go off anywhere within the Linked area; for instance, if a one-yard-radius Create Fire and oneyard-radius Glue spell were linked to a 20-yard-radius Link to catch intruders,  the first intruder to enter the Link's area would find himself in a zone of flaming glue, but subsequent intruders would be safe (from that Link, anyway). The size of the linked spells must be set at the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell either has no effect, or a weaker effect, depending on the spell. The GM's ruling on this is final. Only subjects within the Linked area are affected, unless the spell results in an effect that would not be bound to that area – summoning a demon, for example! The triggering event may occur outside of the area, however. The time to cast the linked spells is spent when initially set up. There is no delay when the Link is triggered – all linked spells are activated instantly. The linked spells do not count as a spell 'on' for any purpose. Every three Link spells on count as one spell on, rounding down. A mage cannot detect a Link simply by looking at it. The Mage Sight spell or the Detect Magic spell will reveal the Link, however. If the mage knows the Conceal Magic spell, the Link may be made harder to detect by magical means. Simply adding the Conceal Magic costs to the base cost of the Link spell accomplishes this effect. The mage must know Conceal Magic to use this option. If the subject of a linked spell is not present at the casting, and has Magic Resistance, refer to the original die roll to determine the results. If the original die roll of the linked spell is not recorded, reroll the spell for this purpose only. Blocking and missile spells cannot be Linked – other spells can. An 'instantaneous' spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires. A single Link can be made to activate a spell when the area is entered, and deactivate the spell when the area is left. This may continue until the linked spell expires. As an example, a mage may cast Link on Continual Light. If he then rolls seven days for the duration of the Continual Light spell (168 hours), he can have the Link set up to turn the Light on when he enters the room, and turn it off when he leaves. When 168 hours of light have been used, both spells expire. For instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes after activating the other spells. No maintenance of a Link is required, either for the Link itself, the linked spells, or any information spells cast on the Link to tell it when to trigger. Link may also be set in reverse, to stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell will last only while the caster maintains it, but the Link itself requires no maintenance. Link can also be used for Limiting Enchantments (see pp. 68-69).",

  "spell-reflex-type": "Special",
  "spell-reflex-description": "This spell is cast on another spell. It converts that spell to function as a Blocking spell for one time only, then disappear. Unlike Delay or Link, a Reflexed spell is triggered by the will of the caster, not by an external event. This means that while Reverse Missiles may be Reflexed to activate if the caster sees someone shoot at him, it will not be triggered by a shot in the back. It is treated as an active defense, similar to Parry or Block for all practical purposes (except retreating does not add 3 to the roll). Casting a Reflexed spell will interrupt any spell the caster is concentrating on, and is handled like any other Blocking spell – see pp. 12-13. When Reflex is cast, the linked spell must be cast immediately after Reflex, by the same caster. Each casting of Reflex will only work on one spell – it is not possible to have multiple spells operate as one Blocking spell. The skill roll for Reflex is rolled at the time of casting, but the roll for the linked spell is not made until it is cast as a Blocking spell. The energy cost for Reflex is paid at the time of casting Reflex, but the energy for the Reflexed spell is not paid until it is cast, whether as an active defense or otherwise. The time to cast a Reflexed spell is spent immediately after the Reflex is cast, but the success roll and energy cost are handled later.  A Reflexed spell counts as one spell 'on' for spellcasting purposes – see p. 10. A Reflexed spell does not count as 'on' when making the roll to cast itself. Thus, if a mage has four Reflexed spells on, any other spell he casts is at -4, but when he casts one of the Reflexed spells, it is only at -3 for the other three Reflexed spells on.  Note that a mage may cast a Reflex on another person. The caster (not the subject) may activate it at any time, using long-distance modifiers. If the linked spell is cast on a subject other than the subject of the Reflex itself, the regular modifier for the distance to that subject is added to the longdistance modifier for the caster.  It is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed!  A Reflexed spell may be cast only once. It then disappears, and no longer counts as a spell on. The effects are immediate, and the duration is instantaneous, not the duration listed for the original spell. This means that it is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed! A Force Dome, for example, would stop one physical attack, then disappear – a fatiguing, but effective, defense! A Created Animal will appear, then disappear before it can make any action. (It might stop a missile during its brief existence, however. The GM may rule such an animal must be nearly equal in size to the target it is shielding.) Exceptions to this instantaneousresult rule are spells with permanent results, such as Major Healing – their effects are indeed permanent. Any person may carry any number of Reflexes. However, only one spell may be cast in any one turn. Remember also, that if a Reflexed spell is used as an active defense, no other active defense may be used against that attack, unless All-Out Defense is chosen. See p. B366. A Reflexed spell may be cast as a regular action – it does not have to be cast as a defense. It takes one second to cast, regardless of the time it would normally require to cast. All normal modifiers for distance and Magic Resistance are used when casting the Reflexed spell, if the subject of the Reflexed spell is distant from the person or object the Reflex itself is cast on.  Example: Felix gives Beast-Soother as a Reflexed spell to Rudolph. Felix then activates a Wizard Eye to keep tabs on Rudolph as he goes hunting. Rudolph meets a short-tempered wild boar, which Felix observes through the Wizard Eye. Rudolph cannot activate the spell. Fortunately, he does not have to! Felix activates Beast-Soother as Rudolph tries an Animal Handling roll to calm the boar. Rudolph has gone about two miles into the woods, so Felix is at -3 for long distance. The boar is 3 yards away from Rudolph, so Felix is at another -3 for the range to the subject of the Reflexed spell. He is also at -1 for having Wizard Eye on. Thus, Felix casts Beast-Soother at -7, and pays the energy for the spell at that time. Fortunately he has it at level 21, so he casts it for the maximum effect. The boar is indeed calmed, and Rudolph goes on his way while Felix rests. The Reflexed BeastSoother spell no longer exists. If Rudolph meets another animal, he's on his own, though Felix may still be observing any action with his Wizard Eye. Blocking spells and Missile spells cannot be Reflexed; other spells can be.",

If the spell is recast the next night, the effects are cumulative.

The hallucination must concern the presence or absence of a single 'thing': one person the subject knows or knew, one crowd of revelers, one pair of shackles on the subject's wrists, one pride of lions ... If it can be described as a single entity in English (without amazing gymnastics), then it should pass. The GM's judgment is final, as usual. The hallucination does not require concentration: the subject supplies, unconsciously, all the 'realism' necessary. By concentrating, the caster can 'direct' the hallucination – put words in the mouth of the absent person, have the revelers head off in a certain direction or start singing a particular song, etc. Impossible or obviously false hallucinations (a long-dead uncle, for example) are Resisted at a bonus of up to +5.",

Penalties: -2 for a place you have 'seen' only through the mind or memories of another, or via television; -2 for a place you have not seen within a month (except, perhaps, your own home!); and -1 to -3 for a place seen only briefly. This spell is dangerous, too. If you fail your roll by 1, you take 1d damage and arrive at your destination physically stunned (HT roll to recover). If you miss your roll by more than 1, you suffer no physical injury – but you go somewhere else. The location is up to the GM! A critical failure with this spell can send the caster anywhere the GM likes – make it interesting! – and cause physical injury, as long as it doesn't kill the caster outright. Even a successful teleport can be confusing. A wizard must roll vs. his Body Sense skill (p. B181) in order to act on the same turn in which he teleports. A failed roll means disorientation – no actions except defense are possible on that turn. A critical failure means he falls down, physically stunned. A teleporter arrives in the same position he started in. He may be facing a different direction, but this makes it more likely that he will be disoriented on arrival: -2 to change facing, -5 to go from vertical to horizontal or vice versa!

The container can be any size, from a small bottle up to an entire building, but it must be fully, tightly closed (watertight is good enough), and the mage must touch it while casting the spell. The spirit cannot resist the spell, but the casting cost is directly proportional to its power. The total cost is equal to the spirit's ST + IQ, divided by 5 to cast and by 10 to maintain. It takes a true effort to restrain a powerful spirit! The caster is informed of the energy cost when the spell takes effect and spends the energy then; if he cannot meet the cost, the spirit is unaffected. If the caster spends half the energy cost, the spirit takes one second to break out of the trap; this is a bad deal, but sometimes buying even a second is a worthwhile thing to do. If multiple spirits are trapped in a single container, add half the others' ST and IQ to the full ST and IQ of the most powerful spirit before calculating cost. The spirit cannot damage the container or affect anything outside of it, nor can it use shape-shifting powers to help it escape in any way.

He retains his personality, knowledge, IQ, skills, and spells, and all his mental advantages and disadvantages (including Magery), but gains the physical and supernatural traits of a lich, as determined by the GM. The more powerful that package, the higher the energy cost. After the GM determines the lich template (and hence, the energy cost), the mage casts this spell as with any other enchantment, but with himself as the subject. At the end of the enchanting, he rolls against skill. Any failure does 6d damage to the caster. A success prepares the wizard's body for the next step. To complete the transformation, the would-be lich must drink an alchemical elixir of Lichdom. The elixir of Lichdom is prepared like any other alchemical elixir (see p. 210); it requires $13,500 in materials and 50 weeks of brewing. It defaults to Alchemy-7. Anyone not currently under the effects of a Lich spell who imbibes an elixir of Lichdom is affected as if he had drunk an elixir of Death (p. 215). However, an elixir of Lichdom cannot be counteracted, even with an alchemical Antidote. The elixir of Lichdom is forbidden everywhere, and formularies for it are almost impossible to find; most liches are compelled to reinvent it from scratch. When a wizard under the Lich spell drinks a potion of Lichdom, he must roll vs. HT. If he succeeds, he dies, rising as a lich in 2d days. If he fails, he just dies. Luck, as well as the Bless and Wish spells, can influence this HT roll. This is also an Enchantment spell.  Lich 105 points Attribute Modifiers: ST-1 [-10]; DX+2 [40]; HT+2 [20].

The spell is Resisted normally by HT. If the subject ever fails to resist (or chooses not to), he 'dies' and rises as a wraith 24 hours later. The GM determines the exact abilities of the wraith, but mental traits are preserved as per the Lich spell. The wraith always has a Dependency (p. B130) on the Wraith item (a rare item, required constantly, for -150 points), and shrivels and dies if it is removed or destroyed. This item isn't Hexed; the victim can remove it and die if he wishes. Only Remove Enchantment can reverse the Wraith spell without harm. Each Wraith item can sustain one wraith at a time. Once a given item has produced a wraith, it has no effect on other wearers until its wraith has been destroyed. The Wraith spell has no effect on the undead. At double energy cost, the enchanter can create an item that makes the wraith his undead servant. The wraith automatically gains Reprogrammable (p. B150) with the enchanter as his master in addition to his Dependency, and cannot remove the Wraith item himself. At half cost, the enchanter can create an item that turns the wearer into an undead tomb guardian.

A wizard in plant shape may cast no spells unless he knows them so well that he can cast them without speech or gesture! He may hear normally but may not see except to sense light and darkness. He may not speak. Injuries taken in plant form carry over proportionately. This means, for instance, that an arrow wound to a tree is a pinprick to a man; some GM flexibility is required here! Time spent in plant form automatically counts as 'rest' unless the plant is under attack. However, he must roll against IQ every hour that he stays in plant form.

Two seconds after the geyser starts, the water begins to fall back as spray. Under normal conditions, it affects an area double the radius of the original geyser.

Two seconds later, all those within 4 yards, but not within 2 yards, suffer 1d of damage. If the caster is in the geyser area, he takes normal damage, but if he is in the spray area, he is unharmed. The geyser must always spring from the earth; it would not work on a rooftop.
