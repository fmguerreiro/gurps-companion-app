CHAPTER THREE

Purify Air
Area
Removes all impurities from the
air in its area of effect. It is often used
to neutralize the effects of poisonous
gas or vapors. Note that a room full of
smoke may safely be purified one section at a time – but truly deadly vapors
must all be removed at once, or some
may escape.
This spell can also turn old “stale”
air into fresh breathable air. The air in
a one-yard radius, if not renewed from
the outside, lasts 45 minutes for one
person at rest, or less for multiple persons or someone violently exercising
(GM’s discretion).

Duration: Works instantly. Purification is permanent.
Base cost: 1. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 50.

Seek Air
Information

Tells the caster the direction and
approximate distance of the nearest
significant amount of air. Use the
long-distance modifiers (p. 14). In settings where air is understood as a
combination of gases, the caster may
also seek out a specific gas or combination of gases, rather than ordinary
air. Any known source of air may be
excluded if the caster specifically
mentions it before beginning.
Cost: 1.

Item
A forked stick (usually of bird
bone). Cost to create: 60 energy and a
$200 onyx.

Create Air
Area
Manufactures air where none
exists. When cast where there is
already air, it produces an outward
breeze lasting about five seconds.
When cast in a vacuum, it instantly
creates breathable air. When cast
within earth, stone, or other material,
it fills any empty spaces with air, but
does not burst the stone. When cast
underwater, it makes bubbles! When
cast on a one-yard-radius area, the
spell creates about 45 cubic feet of air
every second for five seconds; each
cubic foot of air will last a single person at rest about a minute. However,
in some environments the air created
will rapidly dissipate into vacuum or
bubble away. This spell cannot be cast
inside a living being.
Duration: Breeze, bubbles, etc. last
5 seconds. Air created is permanent.
Base cost: 1. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisite: Purify Air or Seek Air.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 200.


No-Smell
Regular
Removes the subject’s odor and
makes it (or him) totally undetectable
by smell. Any possessions are also
affected. This spell changes no other
properties of the subject.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Purify Air.

Item
Jewelry; only affects the wearer.
Cost to create: 150 energy and $300.

Stench
Area
Produces a cloud of vile, yellowish
gas that reeks of brimstone. Until it
dissipates, anyone who breathes it
must make a HT roll or take 1d damage. Roll once per minute. Those in
the area begin to suffocate (see
Suffocation, p. B436). The cloud is
heavy, and “rolls” downhill if the
ground is not level. The rate of dissipation depends on the area and presence of wind; indoors, it usually lasts
until the spell expires, but outdoors on
a windy day, it might only last 10 seconds or so. Those with Doesn’t
Breathe or Filter Lungs are immune to
the toxic effects of the gas.
Duration: 5 minutes, except in
windy areas.
Base cost: 1. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisite: Purify Air.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 60.

Destroy Air
Area
Destroy all air within a designated
area of effect. This can create a vacuum within a very strong vessel, but in
open air it just causes a momentary
thunderclap as surrounding air rushes
in. This effect does 1d-2 damage to
anyone in the area of effect who fails a
HT roll. Any beings with the Body of
Air meta-trait (p. B262) take 2d damage. In certain situations (e.g., in an
airtight room) this spell can be much
deadlier, leaving no air to breathe.

Duration: Lasts only an instant, but
destroyed air stays gone.
Base cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Create Air.

Odor
Area
Produces any odor the caster is
familiar with. The odor lingers for
about an hour, gradually diminishing
(outdoors it spreads out and quickly
dissipates). The spell produces no
other physical effects – for instance,
the odor of a poison is not poisonous.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisite: No-Smell.

Item
Jewelry that constantly surrounds
the wearer with one scent (set at time
of casting). Energy cost to create: 40.

Shape Air
Regular
Create movements of air over a
small area. The caster must choose a
starting point (calculate distance
penalties from that point). The wind
starts there and blows in a stream one
yard wide, for a distance in yards
equal to 5 times the energy put into
the spell, and then dissipates. This
may cause knockback (see Knockback,
p. B378) on someone it hits; each second, roll 1d per full 2 points of energy
in the spell. Treat this as damage for
knockback purposes only (this spell
does not cause injury).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 10. 1 produces a gentle
breeze; 4 a wind; 6 a heavy wind; 8 or
more a violent blast. Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Create Air.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 200.

Air Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin jet of air from one finger. Each turn, the caster rolls versus
DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit. This
attack may be dodged or blocked, but
not parried. The jet does 2d knockback damage for every point of energy


put into the spell, and has a range in
yards equal to the number of dice in
the attack. The jet does injury damage
to vaporous beings or swarms. It is
also good for sweeping the floor.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Air.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; if the item is a staff or
wand, the air jet comes from its tip.
Energy cost to create: 200.

Air Vision
Regular
See clearly through smoke, fog,
dust, sand, etc., eliminating any Vision
penalties caused by the condition of
the air around him.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 per mile to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Air.

Item
Any. Energy cost to create: 200.

Body of Air
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject’s body becomes
vaporous, temporarily granting the
subject the Body of Air meta-trait
(p. B262). Clothes (up to 6 pounds)
also become vaporous, but lose any
magic powers they might have had
while in this form.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Air.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry; only
affects the wearer. Unfortunately, as
soon as it is activated, the item falls
through the user’s hand – thus, a spell
cast with this item lasts only a minute.
Energy cost to create: 800. (b) Staff,
wand, or jewelry. Unlike the previous
item, this item becomes vaporous
along with the subject, allowing the
subject to maintain the spell longer
than 1 minute. It loses any other
magic powers it might have while in
vaporous form. Energy cost to create:
1,500.

Devitalize Air
Area
Removes
the
life-sustaining
essence from the air within its area of
effect, rendering it unbreathable. Until
the “dead” air dissipates, any being
who needs to breathe begins to suffocate (see Suffocation, p. B436), and
flames within the spell’s area of effect
flicker and die. Victims may not notice
the spell’s effect until they begin losing
FP; roll vs. Per to notice the changed
quality of the air. Sleeping victims
must roll vs. HT to wake up once they
begin suffocating.
The spell lasts until living air diffuses back into the affected area. This
takes 1 minute per yard of radius in an
unventilated area, or as little as 10 seconds on a windy day outdoors. In an
airtight room, the air stays devitalized
indefinitely! Purify Air reverses this
spell’s effects.
Base cost: 2. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisite: Destroy Air.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 300 energy and a $200 onyx.

the height (double for 8 yards high,
triple for 12 yards high, and so on).
Low-tech missiles are buffeted off
course as they cross it, and suffer a -10
penalty to hit for every yard of wall
they pass through. High-tech bullets
suffer a -2 penalty to hit for every yard
of the wall of wind they pass through.
Beings standing within the wall’s thickness are at -3 DX and suffer 2d of
knockback in a random direction
every second.
The wall also churns up loose
ground material, such as dust, small
leaves, insects, and twigs. Each second, beings crossing the wall or standing in it must either shut their eyes or
roll vs. HT to avoid being blinded, as
per a one-point Sand Jet (p. 52) (unless
the GM rules that the area is very
clean, with no debris to circulate).
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: The wall appears as
soon as the casting starts, initially surrounding a one-yard-radius area; the
caster may move the perimeter outward at a rate of one yard of radius
per second of concentration.
Prerequisite: Shape Air.

Item

Walk on Air
Regular
Temporarily grants the subject the
Walk on Air advantage (p. B97). If the
subject falls for any reason (e.g.,
injury), the spell will be broken! If the
spell is recast immediately, he falls for
only one second (about 5 yards) and
then “lands” on the air (taking 1d
damage) – unless he hits ground
before then. If he’s 10 feet over a lava
pit, too bad!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Air.

Item
Staff, wand, jewelry, or shoes; only
affects the wearer. Cost to create: 500
energy and $1,000.

Wall of Wind
Area
Surrounds an area with a wall of
roiling air that impedes movement.
The wall is one yard thick and four
yards high, but may be made higher by
multiplying the cost as you multiply

Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Cost to create: 400 energy
and a $500 onyx.

Windstorm
Area
Create a circular windstorm with
an “eye” of calm inside (a good place
for the caster to stand). The radius of
the eye can be up to half that of the
storm – or smaller, if the caster wishes. By concentrating, the caster can
move the storm any distance up to its
own diameter per second; the eye
moves with it. The caster may move
up to half his normal Move inside the
eye while concentrating on this spell.
Anyone within a full-strength
Windstorm must roll vs. ST once per
second to avoid being knocked over by
the wind. All DX-based skills are at -5,
and ranged attacks are at a -10 penalty for every yard of the windstorm
they pass through.
For double energy cost, the caster
may create a more powerful windstorm, like a tornado. ST rolls to
remain standing in such a gale are at
-5, ranged attacks through it are


impossible, and visibility inside it is a
yard at best. This powerful windstorm
physically lifts and hurls objects up to
30 pounds per yard of radius.
Duration: 1 minute after reaching
full strength.
Base cost: 2. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: The storm starts
immediately, but the caster must concentrate for a number of seconds
equal to the storm’s radius in yards to
bring the storm to full strength.
Prerequisite: Shape Air.

Earth to Air
Regular
Turns earth or stone into air, which
can be valuable to someone who is
trapped underground. The more energy the caster spends, the more earth
he can transform, but he is limited to
regular shapes with the largest dimension no more than four times the
smallest one.
This is also an Earth spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 to transform one cubic foot
of earth/stone to air, giving enough air
for one person to breathe for 1
minute. To transform larger quantities
of earth/stone at once, the cost is 5 per
cubic yard. Metal may be turned to air
for triple cost.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Create Air and Shape
Earth.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. The item must touch the
stone to be transformed. Cost to create:
750 energy and $1,000 in jewels.

Missile
The caster creates a ball of highly
pressurized air in his hand. When the
air strikes a target, it explodes. The
blast is extremely loud; anyone within
10 yards must roll against HT-3 or be
stunned. Stunned people may roll
against HT-3 every second to recover.
Protected Hearing gives a +5 bonus to
this roll. Concussion has 1/2D 20, Max
40, Acc 1; roll vs. Innate Attack skill to
hit.
This is also a Sound spell.
Cost: Any amount up to twice your
Magery level per second, for three seconds. For every 2 energy put into the
spell, the missile does 1d crushing
damage. See Explosions, p. B414, for a
full treatment of explosive damage.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Shape Air and
Thunderclap (p. 171).

Essential Air
Creates the magical essence of Air.
Essential Air is “purer” and can be
used (breathed or consumed) three
times as long before becoming foul.
Fire burns hotter (but not faster) in
Essential Air, adding an extra point of
damage to each die (this will even
increase the heat of Essential Flame!).
If the air is created in an open area, it
disperses within 5 seconds.
Duration: Permanent until dispersed or used up.
Base cost: 2.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: At least six Air spells.

Sandstorm
Area
Creates a Windstorm (p. 25) with
the addition of flying sand! The sand is
created by the spell – it is not necessary for the area to be sandy. The
Sandstorm obscures vision (-2 per
intervening yard of Sandstorm,
excluding the “eye” of the storm).
Each second, every being within
the area must shut its eyes or roll vs.
HT to avoid being blinded, as per a
one-point Sand Jet (p. 52).
Duration: 1 minute after reaching

Body of Wind
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject’s body becomes a
whirlwind, with a radius of 2 to 4
yards (caster’s choice). In this form, he
has a variant form of the Body of Air
meta-trait (p. B262); he lacks the
listed Vulnerability to vacuum and

wind-based attacks, he has No Fine
Manipulators rather than the usual
No Manipulators, and he has effective
ST equal to twice his normal ST.
Clothes (up to 6 pounds), also become
wind, but lose any magic powers they
might have had while in wind-form.
Anyone within the radius of the
subject must make a ST roll each second to remain standing. All DX-based
skills are at -5, and missile attacks that
pass through the whirlwind only hit
on a critical success. There is no safe
“eye.”
Duration: 5 minutes.
Cost: 8 to cast. 4 to maintain. Cost
does not multiply when casting it on
larger creatures, as with most Regular
spells.
Time to cast: 2 seconds; the storm
springs into full strength immediately
upon completion of the spell.
Prerequisites: Magery 3; Body of Air
and Windstorm at 16+ each; and one
spell from each of five different colleges besides Air.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry; only
affects the wearer. As soon as it is activated, the item falls through the user’s
hand; thus, a spell cast with this item
lasts only a minute. Cost to create:
1,700 energy and a $1,000 onyx. (b)
Staff, wand, or jewelry; only affects
the wearer. Unlike the previous item,
this item turns to wind along with the
wearer, allowing him to maintain the
spell longer than a minute. While
vaporous, it loses any magical powers
it might have while solid. Cost to
create: 3,500 energy and a $2,500
onyx.

ELEMENTAL SPIRIT SPELLS
These spells deal with spirits
embodying the four classical elements
– air, earth, fire, and water. There are
different spells for each of the four elements, but in general they conform to
the spells given here for air elementals.

Summon (Air)
Elemental
Special
This is a different spell for each of
the four elements. It allows the caster
to call a nearby elemental – if one
exists. In general, the GM should
assume that an elemental is available
if the location is appropriate, unless
the scenario or situation requires that
elementals are opportunely absent.
The caster determines the elemental’s


power level by the amount of energy
he spends on the spell, but the GM
determines the elemental’s precise
capabilities.
The summoned elemental is not
under the caster’s control, but must
remain for one hour unless it is dismissed or destroys the caster. Note
that a dismissal does not guarantee
the elemental will leave. If it is hostile,
or simply curious, it may choose to
stay!

a noncumulative +2 bonus to any
attempt to use the spell. Cost to create:
1,000 energy, $1,300 gold and platinum.

Create (Air) Elemental
Special

The caster may question the summoned elemental, request a service,
etc. The elemental immediately makes
a reaction roll to see how it feels about
the wizard. On a good reaction, the
elemental cooperates for an hour – no
longer – and then vanishes. An elemental’s opinion may be swayed with
appropriate enticements, assuming a
wizard can figure out what an
elemental might desire.
Duration: One hour. May not be
maintained.
Cost: 1 point per 10 character
points used to build the elemental.
Minimum energy cost is 4 (although
this will not always summon a 40point being).
Time to cast: 30 seconds. The elemental may take up to 2d minutes to
appear.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and either
eight spells of the appropriate element
or four spells of the appropriate
element and another Summon
Elemental spell.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry decorated
with appropriate elemental images – a
different enchantment is required for
each of the four types. Cost to create:
800 energy, $1,300 gold and platinum.

Control (Air) Elemental
Regular; Resisted by
higher of ST and Will
Control all actions of a single elemental while the spell continues. For
direct control, the elemental must
remain within the caster’s view. If the
elemental is simply told to leave, it
does so. If the elemental is sent to do a
task, rather than controlled directly,

its IQ must be sufficient (GM’s decision) to comprehend its instructions!
This spell can also be used as an
information spell, to judge the four
attributes of that type of elemental
(within 15 feet). A successful roll is
required, but there is no energy cost.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 point per 10 character
points used to build the elemental.
Half that (round up) to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Summon Elemental
for the appropriate element.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry decorated
with appropriate elemental images – a
different enchantment is required for
each of the four types. This item does
not let the user cast the spell, but gives

Create a spirit of the appropriate
element. The caster may determine the
capabilities of the created elemental by
increasing or decreasing the attributes
of the basic elemental of that type; he
may only change, add or subtract
advantages and disadvantages with
GM permission. There are no limits to
the alteration of attributes, though a
very stupid elemental will not understand complex commands. A newly
created elemental serves the caster
obediently for one hour. At the end of
that time, roll a contest between the
caster’s skill with the spell, and the elemental’s combined IQ and ST. If the
caster wins, the elemental serves for a
further hour, at the end of which
another contest is required, and so on.
When the caster loses, the elemental
escapes control and leaves (or attacks,
on a very bad reaction).
Cost: 1 point per 5 character points
used to build the elemental.
Time to cast: Seconds equal to the
total character points used to build the
elemental.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Control
Elemental for the appropriate element.

Small Air Elemental
This basic air elemental is summoned by casting Summon Air
Elemental at the minimum energy cost of 4. More energy put into the
spell summons a more powerful elemental. Usually, this simply means a
larger elemental; 1 point of energy is equal to 1 additional point of ST, 5
HP, or 2 points of DR. However, the GM may choose to build a more exotic elemental, adding unusual traits to the following template, or working
one up from scratch.

Small Air Elemental
40 points
Attribute Modifiers: ST-4 [-40]; DX-1 [-20]; IQ-2 [-40]; HT-3 [-30].
Secondary Characteristic Modifiers: SM -1; HP+2 [4].
Advantages: Doesn’t Breathe [20]; Doesn’t Eat or Drink [10]; Doesn’t
Sleep [20]; Flight (Lighter Than Air, -10%) [36]; Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards [30]; Injury Tolerance (Diffuse) [100].
Disadvantages: No Fine Manipulators [-30]; No Legs (Aerial) [0];
Vulnerability (Vacuum and wind-based attacks ¥2) [-20].

ANIMAL SPELLS

Beast-Soother
Regular
Calms a single animal. The beast’s
reaction roll to the caster is improved
by twice the energy put into the spell.
Duration: Permanent, until something disturbs the animal.
Cost: 1 to 3.
Prerequisite: Persuasion or the
Animal Empathy advantage.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 600.

Sample Animal Control Energy Costs
Spell
Vermin Control
Fish Control
Reptile Control
Bird Control
Mammal Control

Beast-Rouser
Regular
Excites a single animal. The beast’s
reaction roll (to anyone) is worsened
by twice the energy put into the spell.
Duration: Until a reaction roll is
called for or an hour passes.
Cost: 1 to 3. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisite: Vexation or the
Animal Empathy advantage.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 500.

(Animal) Control
Regular; Resisted by Will
Controls the actions of one large
animal (any size) or a single swarm
(see Swarm Attacks, p. B461).
Remember, however, that subjects
larger than SM 0 increase the casting
cost. Concentration is required. This
spell will not work on a sapient being
(racial IQ 6 or higher). There is a separate Control spell for each category
of animal.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Variable. Cost to cast is equal
to the racial IQ of the most intelligent
species within the category. Half that
to maintain.
Prerequisite: Beast-Soother.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Allows
the user to control a single species of
animal. Energy cost to create: 100 energy per point of target species’ racial
IQ. (b) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Allows
the user to control any animal within
a category. Energy cost to create: 200
energy times the cost to cast for that
category.

Hybrid Control (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Controls the actions of one large
hybrid creature (any size) or a single
swarm (see Swarm Attacks, p. B461).
Remember, however, that subjects
larger than SM 0 increase the casting
cost. Concentration is required. The

30

caster must know all the Control spells
relevant to the hybrid (controlling a
gryphon would require knowledge of
both Mammal and Bird Control, for
example); his effective skill with this
spell is the lowest of the various spells
involved, including Hybrid Control.
This spell does not work on a sapient
being (racial IQ 6 or higher).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: At least two (Animal)
Control spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 800 (will control only one
particular type of hybrid).

Beast Summoning
Regular
Calls one creature of a named type
(anything under IQ 6). Range does not
matter for this spell. If the spell is cast
successfully, the caster knows the location of the closest creature of the type,
and how long it will take for that creature to come to him. It moves toward
the caster as fast as it can, until the
spell ends or the animal can see the
caster. It stays nearby, without attacking, until the spell ends. The summoned animal then has a +1 on its
reaction to the caster (only). If the caster or someone near the caster attacks
the creature, the spell is broken.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain. To
call many animals, double the cost of
the spell. All creatures within a certain
area (usually about a 10-mile radius;
more for a very successful casting) are
summoned. Of course, the time they
take to arrive depends on the speed at
which they can travel, and if the spell
ends before they arrive, they will turn
and go about their business.
Prerequisite: Beast-Soother.

Cost
1/1
2/1
2/1
3/2
5/3

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 400 for an item that summons one particular species, or 800
for an item that can summon any
beast.

Master
Regular or Blocking;
Resisted by IQ
Holds any beast motionless and
quiet as long as the caster maintains
eye contact and concentration. Note
that darkness breaks eye contact! May
be cast as a Blocking spell if the animal is entering Close Combat range
with the caster – e.g., to attack.
Duration: Indefinite.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Beast-Soother.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 800.

Beast Link
Regular
Establishes a mental link with an
animal. The animal will not stray far
from the caster after that (generally
not more than a half-hour’s travel). It
will then come, once, whenever the
caster wishes, at a fast but not killing
pace. If it is a wild beast, any reactions
must be re-determined when the creature arrives; previous good reactions
from Beast-Soother, for instance, no
longer hold! This spell is similar to
Beast-Summoning, but is cast in
advance and on a specific creature.
Duration: Until the beast is next
called. This counts as a spell “on.”
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Beast Summoning.

Item
Matched amulets. The gold one is
worn by the human, the silver one by
the animal. This gives the human the
power to cast the Beast Link, or (if
self-powered) creates the link automatically. Energy cost to create: 500 for
the pair.

Beast Speech
Regular
Communicate with any animal in the creature’s own “language.” The amount of information exchanged depends on the animal’s intelligence; no creature below the level of a bird is likely to know much of interest. An ant may crawl over gold, but it knows only that the material is hard and inedible. Each minute of the spell allows one question and answer.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Prerequisite: Beast Summoning.
Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost to create: 1,000 for an item that talks to one particular species, or 4,000 for an item that can talk to any creature.

Repel (Animal)
Area
Repels animals from an area. The spell resists attempts by animals to enter it (or stay in it) every second; roll a Quick Contest between the caster’s effective skill and the Animal’s ST.
Like (Animal) Control, this is actu- ally several different spells. There is a Repel (Animal) spell for each category of animal. Like all Area spells, the affected area extends 4 yards upward (an important detail for flying animals such as bats or birds). Casters may extend the area upward by spending proportionately more energy; double base cost will create an area 8 yards high, and so on. Beings with Animal Empathy may feel uneasy and irritable while in the affected area.
The caster may exclude specific animals from the spell’s effect at the time of casting; thus, a shepherd may drive off wolves without driving away his flock.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: Equal to the cost to cast
(Animal) Control for the affected animal type.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: The (Animal) Control spell appropriate to the type of animal to be repelled.

Item
An area can be made permanently repellent at an energy cost of 100 times normal.


Repel Hybrids (VH)
Area
Repels hybrids from an area. The
spell resists attempts by hybrids to
enter it (or stay in it); every second,
roll a Quick Contest between the caster’s effective skill and the beast’s ST.
The caster must know all the Repel
(Animal) spells relevant to the hybrid;
his effective skill with this spell is the
lowest of the various spells involved,
including Repel Hybrids. Beings with
Animal Empathy may feel uneasy and
irritable while in the area.
The caster may exclude specific
animals from the spell’s effect at the
time of casting.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Hybrid Control.

Item
An area can be made permanently
repellent at an energy cost of 100
times normal.

Rider
Regular
Mount and ride a subject creature
as though it were a trained, loyal riding animal. The creature must be
capable of carrying the caster, and the
caster must still make a Riding roll
whenever it would normally be Staff, wand, or jewelry. The spell
does not affect the creature until the
would-be rider actually mounts it. If
the rider dismounts, the creature will
remain docile for about a minute
before fleeing or attacking (whichever
is its nature). Energy cost to create: 800
for an item that controls one particular species, or 3,000 for an item that
can control any creature.

Rider Within
Regular
Works on any type of animal (but
not sapient beings). This is the animal
version of the Soul Rider spell. The
caster becomes able to see through the
subject’s eyes, hear through its ears,
etc, as long as he concentrates. (He
also remains aware of his own body
and may act normally.) The caster
exerts no control whatsoever over the
subject, and the subject is unaware the
caster is “watching.”
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: At least two different
(Animal) Control spells. The caster
must also know the (Animal) Control
spell for the type of animal being “ridden” before he can use this spell on
that type of animal.

Item
A pair of identical pieces of jewelry
– one gold, one silver. The gold one
must be worn by the caster, the silver
one by the subject (e.g., on a collar).
The spell can then be cast at any time,
regardless of distance. Usable only by
a mage. If a Powerstone is included in
the item, it is in the gold one. If either
item is broken, the other loses its
enchantment. Energy cost to create:
1,000 (for the pair). Each of the pair
must contain an opal worth $100.

Information
This spell is similar to Seeker
(p. 105), but it works only on animals.
It may be cast for any species of
animal, an individual, or simply any
animal.
Cost: 3. One try per week per
species.
Prerequisites:
Either
Beast
Summoning and at least two other
Seek spells, or Seeker.

Item

Spider Silk
Special; Missile
The caster shoots a strand of spider
silk, which stretches from his fingertip
to the target. The strands appear wispy
and weightless, but are very strong,
and can support up to 500 pounds
without snapping. As a missile, the
strand has 1/2D n/a, Max equal to
strand length, Acc 3; use the caster’s
DX-4 or Innate Attack to hit. On a hit,
the victim as grappled and immobilized as per the Binding advantage
with the Sticky enhancement (see
p. B40). A single strand has an effective
ST of 10 and DR 3. Spider Silk takes
triple damage from fire-based attacks.
The caster may shoot as many
strands as he has arms from a single
casting of Spider Silk; however, the cost
to cast is based on the total length of all
strands created. Thus, a many-armed
spider demon can throw half a dozen
strands at once, but it won’t be cheap.
Strands of Spider Silk may also be
used to build a web by anchoring successive strands between two surfaces.
This web creates an area that will
grapple anyone who passes through it;
mechanically, this is similar to a
Binding attack with the Sticky and
Area Effect enhancements (p. B40).
The web has ST 10 and DR 3, plus 1
ST for each additional strand.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to cast per 5 yards of strand
length (maximum 100 yards). Half
that to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and two
Animal spells.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The item must bear a picture
of a spider. The strand is shot from the
item’s tip. Energy cost to create: 400.

Beast Seeker
Information
This spell is similar to Seeker (p. 105), but it works only on animals. It may be cast for any species of animal, an individual, or simply any animal.
Cost: 3. One try per week per species.
Prerequisites: Either Beast Summoning and at least two other Seek spells, or Seeker.


Beast Possession
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Rider Within – except caster is
in full control of the subject, “from the
inside,” and has full access to the
beast’s memories and abilities. While
in the subject’s body, the caster may
use all its skills and abilities as though
they were his own. He may use his
own mental abilities, but not his physical ones (so he cannot cast spells
unless he knows them so well that
they require no speech or gesture).
The caster’s own body lies unconscious during the spell, and must be
safeguarded.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Rider Within or
Possession.

Item
As for Rider Within, but more costly. Energy cost to create: 1,500 (for the
pair). Each of the pair must include an
opal worth $200.

Permanent Beast
Possession (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Beast Possession, but the caster’s consciousness remains in the body
of the subject until he chooses to leave
or is “exorcised” by a Dispel
Possession, Counterspell, Remove
Curse, or similar spell. Remember that
the caster must know the appropriate
(Animal) Control spell for the spell to
work on the chosen subject. The caster’s body is in Suspended Animation
(p. 94) while the spell continues. If the
caster’s body dies, the spell is broken.
Whenever the subject body takes damage, the caster must roll against his
own body’s HT or take the same
damage. If the subject animal dies, the
caster must roll vs. HT or die himself!
In addition, the caster must roll
against his IQ every day; a failed roll
means that he loses one point of IQ.
The caster does not need to roll once
he reaches the beast’s normal IQ
range. The lost IQ is regained when
the spell is ended. Should IQ drop to 5,
only Remove Curse or Dispel
Possession will end the spell.
Duration: Indefinite (could be permanent).
Cost: 20.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Beast
Possession.

Item
Cap, crown, helmet, or other headgear. The item must bear a picture of
the animal form it is usable on. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
2,000.

Protect Animal
Area
Cast on an area, this spell protects
all animals of a certain kind within its
borders. Attempts to harm them are
warded off as if by invisible defenders;
protected animals gain DB +3 and DR
5.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Armor, Watchdog,
and any three Animal spells.

Shapeshifting (VH)
Special
Change to the form of an animal.
Each animal form is a different spell,

to be learned separately. The caster
may only learn the form of an animal
with which he is familiar. Many
worlds have only a limited number of
animal forms available. Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the beastform is taken and reappear when the
human form is resumed (magical jewelry cannot be detected while “vanished”). Backpacks, carried items, etc.,
simply fall to the ground.
The caster retains his intelligence,
but gains all the physical attributes of
the new form. This means that the
wearer cannot cast spells unless he
knows them so well that they can be
performed without gestures! Note that
Fatigue Points are not increased for
spellcasting purposes.
Each hour that the spell continues,
the caster must make a roll against IQ;
failure means that the caster loses a
point of IQ, continuing until the normal IQ of that beast is reached.
Should the caster’s IQ drop to 5, he is
trapped in beast form forever unless
the spell is removed by Remove Curse
(other spells won’t counter it). Lost IQ
is regained when human form is
reassumed.
For most natural beast forms, an
energy cost of 6 to cast and 2 to maintain is appropriate; animals with great
strength, for example, tend to be counterbalanced by reduced agility. If the
GM allows supernatural creatures as
beast forms, however, or if he is concerned about the power of a given animal form, he may wish to change the
cost of the spell. A reasonable guideline is to calculate the point value of
the physical characteristics of the
beast form and charge 1/20 of the
form’s cost to cast and 1/60 to maintain, with a minimum cost of 3 to cast
and 1 to maintain.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Varies (see above).
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1, and at least
six other spells of any type.

Item
(a) Jewelry. The item must bear the
likeness of the shape to be taken; usable
only by a mage, or by someone descended from a natural were. It remains with
the caster when the spell is cast – therefore, a collar or necklace is most convenient. There is no cost to maintain the
spell, but the caster cannot change back

unless he still has the item; otherwise, a
Remove Curse spell must be used if he is
to regain normal form. Energy cost to
create: 1,500. (b) Skin of the shape to be
taken. As above, but merges into the
subject and so cannot be lost! Energy
cost to create: 3,000.

Shapeshift Others (VH)
Special; Resisted by Will
As Shapeshifting, but usable on
others. The subject cannot end the
spell; only the caster, or a Remove
Curse spell, can do that. If the spell
continues until the subject’s IQ drops
to 5, he is trapped in the beast form!
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: As Shapeshifting, but the
minimum cost of the spell is 6 to cast
and 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 2 and
Shapeshifting for that form.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by a
mage; the item must touch the subject. Energy cost to create: 3,000. (b)
Skin of the shape to be taken. Always
on. Placed on the subject, it puts the
spell on him permanently (soon causing IQ loss as per Shapeshifting) until
it is taken off by Remove Curse; the
item may then be reused. Energy cost
to create: 3,000.

Permanent
Shapeshifting (VH)
Regular
Like Shapeshifting, but the subject
remains in animal form until he
chooses to resume his normal form.
He must roll for IQ loss daily rather
than hourly.
Duration: Indefinite (could be permanent).
Cost: 5 times the cost of the corresponding Shapeshifting spell.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Shapeshifting for that form.

Item
(a) Jewelry. The item must bear a
picture of the form to be taken. Usable
only by a mage or a descendant of a
natural were. It remains with the subject when the spell is cast; note that
the subject cannot end the spell if he
loses the item while in beast form (if
he does, only Remove Curse can turn
him back!). Energy cost to create:
3,000. (b) Skin of the shape to be
taken. As above, but merges into the
subject and cannot be lost. Energy cost
to create: 4,500.

Partial Shapeshifting (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
As Shapeshifting, but affects only
one body part. The subject of the spell
can be the caster or someone else.
Each variation is a separate spell.
The resulting body part preserves
the subject’s scale: Shapeshifting a
human’s head into a hummingbird’s
head results in a human with a
human-sized hummingbird head.
Some variations bear misleading
titles: Crocodile Jaws, for example,
transforms the subject’s entire head,
not just his jaws – the jaw muscles
must be properly anchored!
Some known variations are:
Chameleon Eyes (3 to cast): The
subject gains Enhanced Tracking 1
(p. B53) and Peripheral Vision
(p. B74).
Crocodile Jaws (5 to cast): The subject’s head becomes a crocodile’s,
granting the subject Sharp Teeth
(p. B91) and a ST of 20 for the purposes of biting only. Speech is slurred
but intelligible. He also gains
Peripheral Vision and Colorblindness
(p. B127) as side effects.
Elephant Trunk (3 to cast): The subject’s nose becomes a trunk, granting
him an Extra Arm (p. B53). He also
gains
Peripheral
Vision
and
Colorblindness as side effects.
Feathered Arms (3 to cast): The
subject’s arms transform into wings,
giving him Flight (Winged) (p. B56).

Fish Tail (3 to cast): The subject’s
legs fuse into a single powerful fluke,
giving him Enhanced Move 1 (Water)
(p. B52).
Mountain Goat Hooves (4 to cast):
The subject’s feet become mountain
goat hooves, granting him Climbing14 (only usable while mountaineering) and Jumping-14.
Saber Teeth (5 to cast): The subject’s
canines become saber-teeth, granting
him Fangs (p. B91) and ST 25 for the
purposes of biting only. Speech is
slightly slurred. The subject acquires
Colorblindness as a side effect.
Scorpion Tail (7 to cast): The subject grows a scorpion’s stinger, complete with poison gland. This is an
Impaling Striker (p. B88) with the
Follow-Up enhancement; on a successful penetrating hit, a 1d+2 Innate
Attack (Toxic, Melee Attack,
Resistible) takes effect. A victim may
resist the scorpion venom by making a
HT-6 roll.
Serpent’s Fangs (3 to cast): The subject’s canines become fangs, able to
deliver a venomous bite; this is a 1d+1
Innate Attack (Melee Attack, Contact
Agent, Toxic, Resistible (HT-4), Cyclic
(daily, expires after three days)).
Skunk Tail (3 to cast): The subject
grows a huge skunk’s tail (2 yards
long), and gains the ability to use the
Stench spell (p. 24) at will. The area of
effect is two yards in radius and must
be centered on some portion of the
tail. This ability costs 2 FP to use.
Spider Arms (7 to cast): The subject
grows two Extra Arms and gains one
Extra Attack (p. B53).
Tiger Paws (4 to cast): The subject’s
hands become tiger paws, granting
him Sharp Claws and Striking ST
24, but he also gains No Fine
Manipulators (p. B145).
Toad Tongue (3 to cast): The subject’s tongue becomes long and adhesive, serving as an Extra Arm with the
Long and Weak enhancements and
additional Striking ST – it attacks with
the subject’s full strength, but lifts with
only 1/4 of the subject’s ST. The subject also gains Peripheral Vision as a
side effect.
Turtle Shell (10 to cast): The subject
becomes encased in a turtle shell. It
has DR 5 and weighs 4 pounds per
point of ST of the subject.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Varies; never less than 3. One
third (round up) to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Shapeshift
Others for the appropriate animal,
and Alter Body.

Item
The item’s form depends on the
body part affected – gloves to
shapeshift the hands, boots for the
feet, a mask for the face, and so on. It
must bear a likeness of the shape to be
taken. There is no cost to maintain;
the spell ends when the user mimics
pulling off the item. Energy cost to create: 1,000 plus 250 per point of casting
cost.

Great Shapeshift (VH)
Special
Perform multiple, fast, repeated
changes of shape, temporarily accessing the Morph ability (p. B84). The
spell lapses, however, if at any point
the caster returns to his natural form.
The caster is mentally stunned when
the spell ends.
Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the spell is cast, reappearing
when it lapses (magical jewelry cannot
be detected while “vanished”). Items
that the caster was carrying when the
spell was cast (including backpacks,
etc.) simply fall to the ground.
At its minimum cost, Great
Shapeshift allows the caster to change
into any creature whose racial template costs 0 points or less (note that
this is slightly different from the
Morph ability). Each additional point
of energy, however, adds 5 character
points to the maximum point value of
the allowable templates.
A caster remains subject to the
Magic Rituals requirements (p. 8)
while shapeshifted; if he changes into
a form that cannot gesture or speak,
he cannot use any spell known at a
skill less than 20.
Mages who know Great Shapeshift
can use Counterspell to hold a Great
Shapeshifted caster in whatever form
he currently has, for as many seconds
as the Counterspell wins the contest by
(or until the Great Shapeshift lapses).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 20 to cast, plus 1 per additional 5 character points of template
limit. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Alter Body,
four types of Shapeshifting, and at
least 10 other spells of any kind.

Item
Jewelry, decorated with an abundance of animal motifs. Usable only
by mages. The item vanishes when the
spell is cast, to reappear when it
lapses. Energy cost to create: 5,000.


Climbing
Regular
Gives the subject a strong, sure
grip, increasing his Climbing skill.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 3 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. The increase in the subject’s
Climbing skill is equal to twice the
energy put into the spell.

Item
Shoes, gloves, clothing, or jewelry;
only affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 250 times the maximum

Climbing bonus (no more than 5) the
item can give.

Itch
Regular; Resisted by HT
Causes the subject to itch fiercely
in a spot of the caster’s choice. The
subject is at -2 DX until he takes one
full second to scratch (more, if armor,
etc. is in the way!). Only one Itch spell
can affect a given subject at a time.
Duration: Until subject takes a turn
to scratch.
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.

Item
(a) Staff or wand; usable only by
mages. The item must touch the victim. Energy cost to create: 100. (b) Any
item; always on. The wearer itches
constantly, and remains at -2 DX while
item is worn. Energy cost to create: 60.

Touch
Regular
The subject feels a light touch at a
spot of the caster’s choice. The touch is
easily felt, even through armor, but
has no effect other than to attract the
subject’s attention; it cannot cause
pain or discomfort, but it is very likely
to distract him.
Cost: 1.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 50.

Perfume
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject smells strongly of any
odor that the caster desires. The subject can detect the odor, but does not
find it especially offensive (although
his companions certainly might),
regardless of its nature.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Odor (p. 24).

Item
Staff or wand. The item must
touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 200.

Spasm
Regular; Resisted by HT
Can be directed against any of the
subject’s voluntary muscles. Directed
against a hand, it causes the subject to
drop whatever he is holding (usually a
weapon). If the subject is in the middle of a lengthy spell requiring gestures, he must make a DX roll or start
over. Ingenious casters will find other
uses . . .
Duration: Instant.
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisite: Itch.

Item
(a) Staff or wand; usable only by
mages. The item must touch the victim. Energy cost to create: 300. (b) Any
item; always on. The wearer must roll
vs. HT each time he does something
delicate (e.g., pick a lock, cast a spell)
or suffer a spasm as above. Energy cost
to create: 100.

Stop Spasm
Regular
Stops any seizure the subject is
undergoing. This works against
epilepsy, vomiting fits, etc.
This is also a Healing spell.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite:
Vitality.

Spasm

or

Lend

35

Item

Item

(a) Staff or wand, decorated in a
snake pattern. Usable only by a mage
or a nonmage with Physician-15 or
higher. Energy cost to create: 400. (b)
Any item. Always on. The item prevents
its wearer from suffering seizures
(grants a bonus of +5 when resisting
Spasm). Energy cost to create: 750.

(a) Staff or wand; usable only by
mages. The item must touch the victim. Energy cost to create: 400. (b) Any
item; always on. The wearer feels stabbing pain, as above, continuing until
he makes a HT roll. The wearer can do
nothing until he succeeds at the roll!
Energy cost to create: 300.

Tickle
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject feels he is being tickled. If he does not resist, he is helpless with laughter, jerking about to try to escape from his invisible tormentor. This is a serious ticklefest; the victim is inca- pacitated as if by a seizure (see Incapacitating Conditions, p. B428). The subject must make a second Will roll if he tries to keep silent. High/Low Pain Threshold has no effect on the spell’s outcome. Unfazeable characters get a +5 bonus to their resistance roll.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 5 to maintain (requires concentration).
Prerequiste: Spasm

Clumsiness
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject suffers -1 to his DX and DX-based skills for every point of energy put into the spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 5 to cast. Half that to maintain (round up).
Prerequisite: Spasm.



Hinder
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject is at -1 to his Move and Dodge scores for every point of energy put into the spell.
This is also a Movement spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 4 to cast. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Clumsiness or Haste (p. 142).
Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by mages; the item must be pointed at (but not necessarily touch) subject. Energy cost to create: 600. (b) Any item. Always on; reduces wearer’s Move score. Energy cost to create: 200 for every 1-yard reduction in wearer’s Move.


Pain
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject feels a stab of agonizing pain. He must make a Will roll to
avoid crying out. If he is in a precarious position (climbing, for instance),
he must make a DX roll to avoid catastrophe! His DX and all DX-based skills
are at -3 for the next second only. If the
subject is in the middle of a spell
requiring gestures, he must roll vs.
Will or start over. High Pain Threshold
gives +3 to the Will and DX rolls
above; Low Pain Threshold gives -4.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Spasm.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 5 to cast. Half that to
maintain (round up).
Prerequisite: Spasm.


Rooted Feet
Regular; Resisted by ST
The subject’s feet are glued in
place! He may try another resistance
roll at -5 every turn, against the original spell skill roll, to break free. While
the spell continues, the subject’s skill
with any weapon except a ranged
weapon is at -2 and his Dodge score is
cut in half (round down).
Duration: 1 minute, or until subject
breaks free.
Cost: 3. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisite: Hinder.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. Energy cost to create: 400. (b) Any
item. Always on; the wearer must
make a (ST-5) roll every turn in order
to move. A failed roll means he cannot
move. Energy cost to create: 600.

Tanglefoot
Regular; Resisted by DX
The subject trips and falls down.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Clumsiness.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must be pointed at
(but not necessarily touching) the
subject. Energy cost to create: 600.

Roundabout
Regular; Resisted by HT
Change the facing of a subject to
any direction desired. This is not a
teleport-in-place, but a physical spin.
On the subject’s next turn, a roll vs.
Body Sense or DX-6 is needed to take
any action. If the subject moved 2 or
more yards the previous turn, he must
make an IQ roll to avoid continuing in
the new direction.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Tanglefoot.

Debility
Regular; Resisted by HT
Reduces the subject’s ST temporarily. This will affect the subject’s basic
damage with weapons, but not HP. It
does affect encumbrance, but GMs are
free to ignore this detail in the interest
of playability.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 for every point of ST reduction (maximum 5). Half that amount
(round up) to maintain.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by

item. Always on; reduces wearer’s ST.
Energy cost to create: 100 for every
point by which wearer’s ST is reduced.

Frailty
Regular; Resisted by HT
Lowers the subject’s HT temporarily. This affects all considerations that
depend upon HT (Basic Speed, HTbased skills, poison and spell resistance, unconsciousness, death, etc.)
except for those dependent upon FP,
which is unaffected. The cost to cast is
not reduced by high skill.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 per point of HT decrease

subject. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Might
Regular
Raises the subject’s ST temporarily.
This affects damage, encumbrance,
and hit points, but does not heal
wounds. If, when the spell wears off,
the subject’s wounds put him below
-HT, he will have to make a HT roll to
live. High skill does not reduce cost to
cast this spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 for every point of ST
increase (maximum of 5). Same cost
to maintain.
Prerequisite: Lend Energy.

Cost: 4 for every point
of DX increase (maximum
of 5). Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Clumsiness.

(a) Any item. Always on; the wearer’s DX is raised while item is worn!
This is a very rare item. Energy cost to

(maximum 5). (b) Staff or wand.
Usable only by mages; the item must
touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 2,000.

Vigor
Regular
Raises the subject’s HT temporarily. This affects his Basic Speed, FP,
and ability to resist trauma and disease. A caster can raise his HT. If the
subject’s FP when the spell wears off is
below zero, he will immediately take 1
point of damage for every point of
fatigue below zero, risking unconsciousness. High skill does not reduce
cost to cast this spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 for every point of HT
increase (maximum of 5). Same cost
to maintain.
Prerequisite: Lend Vitality or Frailty.

Item

Boost (Attribute)
Regular or Blocking
This spell has four separate variants: Boost Dexterity, Boost Health,
Boost Intelligence, and Boost
Strength. Each must be studied separately, but all four work identically.
This spell raises the subject’s attribute just long enough for a single die roll
or short action – one Quick Contest,
one attribute check, delivering a blow,
readying a weapon, resisting a spell,
throwing an object, etc. It cannot be
used to increase a roll that represents
several seconds of effort, such as a
Regular Contest. The boosted attribute
affects all secondary characteristics
except HP and FP. High skill does not
reduce the cost to cast this spell.
Boost Intelligence is a Mind
Control spell, not a Body Control spell.
Cost: 1 for every point of attribute
increase (maximum of 5).
Prerequisite: Each variant has a different prerequisite:

Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Prerequisite: Spasm and at least
two Light and Darkness spells.

Retch
Regular; Resisted by HT

Fumble
Blocking; Resisted by DX
The subject automatically fumbles
the action he is taking. Regular range
penalties apply. If the action is an
attack or parry, roll on the Critical
Miss Table. A fumbled dodge results in
a fall, and a fumbled block unreadies
the shield. If he was taking some other
action (Move, Ready Weapon, etc), the
GM should determine the result as he
sees fit. “Mental” actions (concentration, speech, and so on) are unaffected, but a spell requiring body motions
of some sort is affected!
Cost: 3.

Regular; Resisted by HT
Inflicts 4 FP and 1 HP of dehydration damage, equivalent to a full day
without water. Dehydration fatigue
may be recovered in full with a full
day’s rest and plentiful water (see
Dehydration, p. B426). HP damage

may render the subject nearly unable
to speak, because his throat will be

Cost: 5.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Debility,
and Destroy Water (p. 185).

impervious to pain. He may ignore
Spasm and other pain-causing spells.

not gain any actual resistance to
injury – only to the pain it causes.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Magery 2 and Pain.

Any item; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Hold Breath
Regular
Temporarily eliminates the caster’s need for air, as if he had Doesn’t Breathe (p. B49). He could thus stay underwater, or in a room full of poison gas, without trouble. This spell does not actually provide air; it simply delays suffocation while the caster seeks (or creates) a safer environment. This spell does not supply pressure support against vacuum or deep sea pressure.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Vigor.

Reflexes
Regular
The subject gains Combat Reflexes (p. B43) for the duration of the spell. The spell has no effect on beings that already have the advantage.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain. Prerequisites: Grace and Haste.
Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the wear- er gains the Combat Reflexes advan- tage. Rare item! Energy cost to create: 1,200. (b) Staff or wand. Usable only by mages. Energy cost to create: 800.


Ambidexterity
Regular
Subject gains Ambidexterity (p. B39) for the duration of the spell. The spell has no effect on beings that already have the advantage. It also only affects a single pair of limbs; beings with more than two limbs require multiple castings of the spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain. Prerequisite: Grace.
Item
(a) Any. Always on; the wearer becomes ambidextrous. A rare item! Energy cost to create: 1,500. (b) Staff or wand. Usable only by mages. Energy cost to create: 500.

Cadence
Regular
Doubles the rate of production of
crafted items by both hastening the
craftsman’s movements and making
them surer, eliminating wasted
strokes. Any use of a skill that creates
or improves a handmade object can be
assisted by this spell; magical craft
work (such as scroll writing or
enchantment) cannot.

Hair Growth
Regular; Resisted by HT
Causes the subject’s hair and nails to grow at a million times the usual rate (meaning an inch of hair every five seconds and an inch of nails every 30 seconds). If left unchecked, such growth interferes with vision (as hair falls in the eyes), movement (as the subject trips on his beard) and handling ability (as nails get in the way). Some bald people appreciate this spell, while it lasts (baldness returns within about a month as the hair falls out naturally).
Duration: 5 seconds.
Cost: 1 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: At least five Body Control spells.

affects only the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 750.

Haircut
Regular; Resisted by HT
Trims the subject’s hair (beard,
mustache, fur, etc.) as the caster sees
fit. To determine the aesthetic quality
of the job, roll against Barber skill (a
DX/Average Professional Skill). Can
also be used to shear sheep, pluck
chickens, or to trim the subject’s nails.
The spell will not blunt the subject’s
claws or horns (although it may give
them a manicure).
Duration: The trim is instantaneous, the cut matter falling at the
subject’s feet.
Cost: 2.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Hair Growth.

(a) The effect may be made permanent (preventing hair from growing
back) for 10 times casting cost. (b)

whoever puts it on, to the style specified by the creator. Energy cost to create: 150. (c) Staff or wand. Energy cost
to create: 300.

Sensitize
Regular; Resisted by HT

sensitive to pain, gaining the Low Pain
Threshold disadvantage (p. B142).
The spell does not affect characters
that already have the disadvantage.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Stun.

Item
(a) Any. Always on; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 300. (b)
Staff or wand. Usable only by mages;
the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 400.

Agonize
Regular; Resisted by HT
Magnifies the subject’s sense of
touch to painful levels: a gentle touch
feels like a blow, someone else’s breath
feels like a scorching flame, a cool
breeze feels like a freezing blast. Even
the contact of his own clothes
becomes unbearable; the subject feels
like his skin is being scraped raw. He
is rendered helpless with agony (see
Incapacitating Conditions, p. B428).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 8 to cast. 6 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Sensitize.

Item
(a) Any. Always on; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 500. (b)
Staff or wand. Usable only by mages;
the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Weaken Blood
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject acquires Hemophilia
(p. B138) for the duration of the spell.
All wounds will cause severe bleeding.
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: 1 day
Cost: 9 to cast. 5 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Sickness or Steal
Vitality.

Item
Any item; always on. The wearer is
a hemophiliac! Energy cost to create:
200. (Usually combined with Hex.)

Strike Numb
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject temporarily loses all
sense of touch, as per the Numb disadvantage (p. B146). This includes the
effects of the Resist Pain spell, so it is
sometimes a blessing in disguise. The
subject does not feel blows (beyond a
jolt), does not feel a pickpocket going
through his possessions, does not feel
the heat of the stove top he is leaning
on . . . If the caster desires, the spell
can selectively numb the subject
(numbing only the arms, for instance).
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Resist Pain.

Item
(a) Any. Always on; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 300. (b)
Staff or wand. Usable only by mages;
the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Choke
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject becomes unable to
breathe (or speak) and suffers the
effects of suffocation (see Suffocation,
p. B436). The spell cannot be maintained; so constant recasting is
required to cut off enough of the
victim’s air supply to do any real harm.
Duration: 30 seconds.
Cost: 4. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
five Body Control spells, including
Spasm.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 200.

Control Limb
Regular; Resisted by Will
One of the subject’s limbs (including wings, tentacles, etc) is under the cast- er’s control! Arms can be made to swing weapons (use the caster’s skill); legs can be made to kick, twist, and so on. The caster must continually concentrate to control the limb once the spell is cast; failure to do so causes the limb to “go dead” for the duration. The victim may attempt to grapple himself to prevent his limb from acting, but he is at -3 on contests of ST or DX with himself!
If a caster forces the subject to attack himself with his own weapon or fist, hit rolls are still required (against the subject’s skill+4), and the victim may Dodge at -2. He can even parry (also at -2) if he has an appro- priate weapon in his other hand! Treat as Close Combat for legal weapons and any appropriate penalties.
Duration: 5 seconds.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain. If cast only on a hand (or analogous limb), the cost to cast or maintain is only 2, but the subject can only be forced to increase or release his grip, and so on. This can still interfere with spellcast- ing gestures, throwing grenades, and discharging firearms . . .
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
five Body Control spells, including
Spasm.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must be pointed at
the subject. Energy cost to create: 800.

Paralyze Limb
Melee; Resisted by HT
The caster must strike the subject
on a limb to trigger this spell (hits elsewhere have no effect). Armor does not
protect. Resolve resistance on contact.
If the subject fails to resist, the subject’s limb is paralyzed; it is considered
crippled for one minute.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
five Body Control spells, including
Clumsiness.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 1,000.


Total Paralysis
Melee; Resisted by HT
The caster must touch the subject on the head (-5 to caster’s attack roll). If the subject fails to resist, he is total- ly paralyzed and cannot move at all for one minute (in the average game, until that battle is over).
Duration: 5 seconds.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain. If cast
only on a hand (or analogous limb),
the cost to cast or maintain is only 2,
but the subject can only be forced to
increase or release his grip, and so on.
This can still interfere with spellcasting gestures, throwing grenades, and
discharging firearms . . .




Wither Limb
Melee; Resisted by HT
The caster must strike the subject on a limb to trigger this spell (hits else- where have no effect). Armor does not protect. Resolve resistance on contact. If the caster wins, the subject’s limb withers immediately; it is crippled for all purposes (see Crippling Injury, p. B420). The subject also takes 1d damage.
Duration: Permanent unless healed
by magic or extraordinary technology.
Cost: 5.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Paralyze Limb.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 2,000.

Strike Barren
Regular; Resisted by HT
Renders infertile any subject that
was capable of producing offspring.
Restoration or Remove Curse will
undo the spell. Used on a plant, this
spell prevents it from ever bearing
pollen, fruit, or seed.
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 5.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Steal
Vitality, and Decay.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. Energy cost to create: 200. (b) Any
item. Always on; the wearer is infertile/barren while the item is worn.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Sickness
Regular; Resisted by HT
As listed under Mind Control Spells
p. 138.

Deathtouch
Melee
The caster must strike the subject
to trigger this spell; hit location is
irrelevant. The subject takes 1d damage per point of energy in the spell.
Armor does not protect. This spell
does affect the undead.
Cost: 1 to 3.
Prerequisite: Wither Limb.

Item
Staff or wand; the item must be
colored jet black. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 2,500.

Alter Voice
Regular; Resisted by HT
Changes the subject’s voice as the
caster wills. If the caster is trying to
duplicate an existing voice, the
“model” voice should be available.
Recreating a familiar voice from
memory is at -2 to skill, -3 or worse if
the caster has only heard the voice a
few times, or a long time ago. Eidetic
Memory is helpful here (p. 51).
The subject’s voice can also be
altered to make it more pleasing or
more grating, granting a bonus or
penalty (from +2 to -2) to reaction rolls
and skills involving vocal communication for the duration of the spell.
The spell cannot “give” a voice to a
mute person. If this spell is used to
permanently improve a PC’s voice
(giving him the Voice advantage), the
GM should require him to pay the
appropriate character points!
This is also a Sound spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain. The
change may be made permanent, as
an enchantment, for a cost of 200.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: At least four Body
Control and four Sound spells.

Item
Any, but usually jewelry. Gives the
wearer a new voice, preset by the
caster. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Alter Visage
Regular; Resisted by HT
Changes the subject’s face as the
caster wills. Any new organs (e.g.,
extra eyes) do not really function.
Other than that, any change is possible. If the caster is trying to duplicate
an existing face, he is at -1 if he does
not have the model (or a good picture)
available; if he is not too familiar with
the model, -2 or worse.
This spell cannot be used to injure
the subject. Mages do not get an automatic IQ + Magery roll to realize
someone is under this spell.
If this spell or Alter Body (below) is
used to permanently improve a PC’s
looks, the GM should require him to
pay the appropriate character points
for the improvement!
Duration: 1 hour unless made permanent. May be removed by Alter
Visage, Alter Body, or Remove Curse.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain. May
be made permanent, as an enchantment, for an energy cost of 40.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Eight Body Control
spells and either Shapeshifting or
Perfect Illusion.

Item
Any, but usually clothing or jewelry.
Gives the wearer a new face, preset by
the caster. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Alter Body
Regular; Resisted by HT
As for Alter Visage, except that the
subject’s entire body (e.g., skin, hair,
limbs) may be altered. The subject’s
general form cannot change:
humanoids stay humanoid. No extra
limbs, wings, etc., may be added.
Simpler additions are possible (nonprehensile tails, horns, hooves), but
the subject will be unfamiliar with
them, and may suffer penalties to DX
until a suitable adjustment period
(GM’s decision) has passed. The subject’s mass must remain the same;
basic stats do not change.
Duration: 1 hour unless made permanent. May be removed by Alter
Body or Remove Curse.
Cost: 8 to cast. 6 to maintain. May
be made permanent, as an enchantment, for an energy cost of 200.
Time to cast: 2 minutes.
Prerequisite: Alter Visage.

Item
Any, but usually clothing or jewelry. Gives the wearer a new appearance, preset by the caster. Energy cost
to create: 4,000.

Lengthen Limb
Regular
The caster’s arm (usually – but legs,
pseudopods and so on are also legal)
lengthens, becoming like a very long
snake. The limb lengthens at a rate of 1
yard per second, with no upper limit.
The caster retains his full sense of
touch, and must feel his way forward
once the end of the limb grows out of
view, or use Wizard Eye or some similar
spell to guide it. He must remain still;
the actual lengthening requires concentration, but the caster may relax once
he has achieved the desired length.
The extended limb may make a
tempting target for whoever happens
on it! When the spell ends, or in an
emergency, the limb is “reeled back in”
at the caster’s full Basic Speed score.
This is useful for reaching the keys
outside the cell, or snatching the
caliph’s prize jewel as he sleeps.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Shapeshifting.

Item
Wand. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Decapitation
Regular; Resisted by HT+2
The subject’s head comes off!
When this spell is cast, the subject’s
head (or one of them, if the subject
has several) comes free of its body,
but continues to live on its own. The
subject is not harmed, but the head
takes falling damage if it is not carefully removed or caught! The head
can talk, see, and control the actions
of its body normally. If the head is
somehow blinded (put in a bag, for
instance), then it will have trouble
telling its body where to walk . . .
The spell, once cast, is permanent
until somebody puts the head back in
the proper place and wills it to attach
(if the head is unwilling, proceed to a
Regular Contest of Wills). If it is cast
on a foe, who then regains the head
and reattaches it, the caster has no say
in the matter, although he can
certainly cast the spell again . . .
This spell, while useful in combat,
has several other uses. A mage with a
broken leg could leave his body
behind and travel with the party as a
head! Note, however, that bodies cannot feed themselves without mouths,
and if the mage attempted to cast a
spell requiring hand motions, the
range penalties would apply from his
body, not his head!
Duration: As above.
Cost: 4.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Alter
Body.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Shrink (VH)
Regular
The caster’s size decreases, reducing his Size modifier. For every 1 point
of SM reduction, the caster’s ST, HP,
and Move are all multiplied by 2/3. For
every 2 points of SM reduction, his DR
is reduced by 1. The caster’s clothing
shrinks with him if he wishes, but jewelry, armor, weapons, carried items,
and other substantial volumes of harder substances remain at their original
size (though they can be reduced
separately with Shrink Object).
IQ, DX, HT, FP, Basic Speed, and
Dodge do not change with size.
Weight decreases dramatically; every
point of SM reduction divides the caster’s weight by 3.5. The caster is harder
to hit, as appropriate to his new SM.
The GM may opt to set a floor of 1
HP and Move 1, so that shrunken wizards may still accomplish something
on foot. This may not be realistic, but
it is in keeping with the traditions of
heroic fiction.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 per -1 SM. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds. Shrinkage
occurs at a rate of 1 SM per second
after the spell is complete.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Alter
Body.

Item
(a) Wand. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 2,000. (b) A size
change can be made permanent for
100 times casting cost (the GM may
require that the subject’s new size be
maintained while the enchantment
goes on!)

Shrink Other (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
As Shrink, but usable on other
beings. The spell can only be countered by the original caster or by
Remove Curse. The GM should keep
in mind the potential psychological
effects of this spell on unaware or
unwilling subjects.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 per -1 SM. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Shrink.

Item
(a) Wand. Usable only by mages;
the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 2,000. (b) A size
change can be made permanent for

require that the subject’s new size be
maintained while the enchantment
goes on!)

Enlarge (VH)
Regular
The caster grows in size, increasing
his Size modifier. For every 1 point of
increased SM, the caster’s ST, HP, and
Basic Move are all multiplied by 1.5.
For every 2 points of increased SM,
his DR increases by 1. The caster’s
clothing grows with him if he wishes,
but jewelry, armor, weapons, carried
items, and other substantial volumes
of harder substances remain at their
original size (though they can be
enlarged separately with Enlarge
Object). See Corpulence, p. 43, for the
effects of “bursting” out of armor.
IQ, DX, HT, FP, Basic Speed, and
Dodge do not change with size.
Weight increases dramatically; every
point of increased SM multiplies the
caster’s weight by 3.5.
If the caster is enclosed in a room
or other space that is too small to
accommodate his larger size, his
growth stops. However, if his maximum thrusting damage is enough to
penetrate the enclosure’s DR, he
bursts through in one second per
point of DR.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 per +1 SM. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Alter
Body.

Item
(a) Wand. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 2,000. (b) A size
change can be made permanent for
100 times casting cost (the GM may
require that the subject’s new size be
maintained while the enchantment
goes on!)

Enlarge Other (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
As Enlarge, but usable on other
beings. The spell can only be countered by the original caster or by
Remove Curse. Cast on a volunteer
soldier, this changes him into an
instant siege engine . . . but also makes
him a prime target for the enemy’s
artillery and magic.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 per +1 SM. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Enlarge.

(a) Wand. Usable only by mages; the
item must touch the subject. Energy

can be made permanent for 100 times
casting cost (the GM may require that
the subject’s new size be maintained
while the enchantment goes on!)

Corpulence (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject’s girth temporarily
increases by one level, going from
Skinny to Normal, from Normal to
Overweight, from Overweight to Fat, or
from Fat to Very Fat, as applicable (see
Build, p. B18, for details). Beyond Very
Fat, the subject’s weight increases by
100% of his base weight (not counting
Fat or Skinny modifiers from this spell
or otherwise) per casting. Subjects
already affected resist repeated
castings at a cumulative +5 per casting.
In addition to the normal effects of
the increased weight, ordinary clothes
will rip; each piece of rigid armor will
constrict, inflicting DR/3 points of
crushing damage (round down), and
then suffocate (p. B436). Once the
subject is incapable of moving, he may
be suffocated by his own weight.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 6 to cast. 6 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.

the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Gauntness (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT

opposite of the Corpulence spell).
Armor and clothing hangs on the subject, hampering him (-2 DX). Beyond
Skinny, the subject loses 20% of his
current weight, and loses 1d FP, per
casting. Repeated castings on alreadyaffected subjects are resisted at a
cumulative +5 per casting.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 6 to cast. 6 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Earth to

mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Item
Jewelry. The item must bear the likeness of the shape to be taken; usable
only by mages. There is no cost to maintain the spell, but the caster cannot
change back unless he still has the item;
otherwise, a Remove Curse spell must
be used if he is to regain normal form.
Energy cost to create: 1,500.

Transform Other
Special; Resisted by Will
As Transform Body, but usable on
others. The subject cannot end the
spell; only the caster, or a Remove
Curse spell, can do that.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: As Transform Body, but the
minimum cost of the spell is 10 to cast
and 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 minutes.

and the appropriate form of
Transform Body.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by

Transform Body
Special
Take the form of another sapient
race. Each race is a different spell, to
be learned separately. The caster may
only learn the form of a race with
which he is familiar. Clothing, jewelry,
and armor do not vanish when the
transformation occurs; a caster who
fails to shed rigid armor may be
painfully squeezed (see Corpulence,
above, for details).
The caster acquires only the physical traits of the new form, keeping his
original mental traits. Note that
Fatigue Points are not increased for
spellcasting purposes.
The energy cost of this spell
depends on the point value of the
assumed form’s physical traits; it costs
1/10 of the form’s cost to cast and 1/20
to maintain, with a minimum of 5 to
cast and 2 to maintain.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Varies (see above).
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Alter Body and three
forms of Shapeshifting.


Transmogrification
Regular; Resisted by Will
Change a person into an inanimate
object of similar weight. The object
may be anything that the caster is
familiar with. A living thing with IQ 0,
such as a plant, qualifies as an inanimate object for this purpose. The subject is conscious throughout the duration of the spell, but cannot take any
action, including spells or psionic
powers. He can dimly hear what goes
on around him and feel whatever his
transformed self is in contact with, but
cannot see or smell anything. If the
object is destroyed, the subject dies; if
it is damaged, the subject will suffer a
proportionate loss of HP upon being
returned to his natural form.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 20. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 minutes.

is hostile, without telling who.
Base cost: 1 (minimum 2).

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 200.


Sense Life
Information; Area

Sense Emotion
Regular

Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Sense Foes.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost

from the roll to cast. Same cost to
maintain (maximum 5).
Prerequisite: Sense Emotion.

Item

Hide Emotion
Regular; Resists
emotion readings
This spell gives its subject the outward appearance of deep calm. It
resists Aura and Sense Emotion (and
Sense Foes, at the GM’s option) as well
as any attempt to gauge the subject’s
emotional state by other means
(Empathy, psionics, Body Language,
etc). This spell is a great favorite of
diplomats, courtiers, and poker players. It can grant up to a +4 bonus
(GM’s judgment) to any skill where
masked emotions are valuable.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Sense Emotion.

Item
Cap, crown, or other headgear.
Energy cost to create: 200.

Truthsayer
Information; Resisted by Will

not. May be cast in two ways:
1. To tell whether the subject has
told any lies in the last five minutes.

great the lie is. If caster is not touching
subject, calculate range as for a
Regular spell.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Sense Emotion.

Item
Crown, helmet, or other headgear.
Energy cost to create: 500.

Dream Viewing
Regular; Resisted by Will
View a subject’s dreams; they
appear on any smooth surface of your
choice (such as a basin of water, mirror, gem facet, etc). Use the longdistance and Mind-Reading modifiers
(p. 14 and p. 46, respectively). If the
caster and subject don’t know each
other, there is a further -2 penalty.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Truthsayer or Sleep.

Item
Mirror. Energy cost to create: 300.

Dream Sending
Regular; Resisted by Will
The caster uses this spell to send a
dream vision to the subject, who must
be asleep at the time of the casting.
The message is seen in dream-symbols
by the subject, who must roll vs. IQ-5 or
a skill such as Fortune-Telling (Dream
Interpretation) (p. B196) to interpret it
correctly. The margin of success of the
roll indicates how well the message is
understood. Use of the Dreaming skill
by the subject could distort or obliterate the message (GM’s discretion).
The caster tells the GM the exact
meaning (it is a good idea to limit the
length of the message to as many
words as the caster has skill with the
spell). The GM, in turn, tells the subject what he understood (roll in secret,
as a critical failure will lead to complete misunderstanding!). Use the
long-distance and Mind-Reading
modifiers (p. 14 and p. 46). If the caster and subject don’t know each other,
there is a further -2 penalty. This is
also a Mind Control spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 3. One try per night. Cannot
be maintained.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Dream Viewing or
Sleep.

Item
Wand or staff. Energy cost to create:

Dream Projection
Regular
Using this spell, the caster projects
his presence into the subject’s dreams
to converse with him. Roll a Quick
Contest of the spell’s skill vs. the subject’s Will every minute; once the subject wins, the spell is broken and no
further contact is possible that night.
Use the long-distance and MindReading modifiers (p. 14 and p. 46). If
the caster and subject don’t know each
other, there is a further -2 penalty. The
subject may use his Dreaming skill
(see p. B188) to help the process; roll
every minute to skip the contest. This
is also a Mind Control spell.
Duration: 1 minute. Each minute
allows the exchange of two sentences
(one from the caster and one from the
subject).
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain. One
try per night.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Dream Sending.

Item
Headgear. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Hide Thoughts
Regular
Resists all Mind-Reading and
Thought-Control attempts on the subject. The “attacking” ability must win a
Quick Contest against this spell in
order to affect the subject. If the
attacking ability pierces Hide
Thoughts, the subject still gets his normal resistance roll (roll separately).
This spell does not affect previously
established mental control.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Truthsayer or Hide
Emotion.

Item

Mind-Reading
Regular; Resisted by Will
Read a subject’s mind. Works on
any living being, but is most useful on
sapient creatures. Detects only surface
thoughts (what the subject is thinking
at that moment). This spell will not
work on sleeping or unconscious subjects. The subject is not aware his
mind is being read, except in the case
of a critical failure.
Modifiers: -2 if the caster does not

Mind-Search (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Search a subject’s mind to find
deep thoughts and knowledge of
things the subject is not thinking
about at the moment. In effect, the
caster may ask one simple question
(answered by no more than 10 words)
per minute, and get the most truthful
answer the subject can give. The subject is not aware of the intrusion,
except in case of a critical failure.
Language is no barrier for this
spell, and the subject may even be
asleep. Subjects of different races may
be harder to mind-search, at the GM’s
discretion.
Modifiers: Same as Mind-Reading,
above. If the subject has magically
been caused to forget something, this
spell cannot recover it.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Mind-Reading.

Item
Cap, crown, helmet, or other headgear. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 1,500.


Mind-Sending
Regular
Send your thoughts to a subject in
a one-way communication. Transmission proceeds at only talking
speed, though the caster may also
send simple pictures (the time
required is equal to the time it would
take the subject to copy the picture on
paper or parchment).
When figuring the distance penalty, use the long-distance modifiers
(p. 14). If caster and subject don’t
know each other, there is an
additional -4 penalty.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Mind-Reading.

Retrogression
Regular; Resisted by Will
Causes a subject to re-experience
an event from his past life (or lives!)
This can be a torment or as a boon.
Different kinds of memories have
different effects. A terrifying memory
requires a Fright Check at -3 or more;
the memory of one’s violent death, for
example (in a campaign where
Resurrection is possible), requires a
Fright Check at -5. The memory of a
wound or illness requires a HT-3 roll;
failure inflicts one point of damage. A
memory of slavery or degradation
reduces Will by 1 for 3d hours unless a
Will-3 roll is made. A memory of personal triumph and power increases
Will by 1 for 3d hours if an IQ roll is
made. The GM judges the effects of
any other type of memory.
The caster only specifies the type of
event to be relived; he cannot use this
spell to “rummage” through the
memories of the subject.
Unless stunned, the subject must
roll his Body Sense to act on the turn
following a Retrogression.
Duration: The memory takes one second to relive (although it may seem like more to the subject).
Cost: 5. Cannot be maintained. One try per day.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Mind-Search and Mind-Sending.

Lend Skill
Regular
Subject gains a skill at (controlling
attribute)+4 or increases his existing

the skill in question (either normally
or by Borrow Skill, below). Does not
work on languages or spells.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Mind-Reading.

Item
Cap, crown, helmet, or other headgear. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 1,500.

Telepathy (VH)
Regular
Full two-way communication, like
Mind-Reading and Mind-Sending
combined. The subject must be willing. Both caster and subject know the
whole of each others’ thoughts and
what the other is experiencing; they
communicate at the speed of thought.
Other people can “enter the link” – a
new casting of the spell (by anyone
involved) is required for each new person to enter. To eavesdrop on an existing telepathic link without being
noticed, there is a -4 skill penalty.
If caster and subject know each
other and the subject expects the
“call,” there is no distance penalty.
Otherwise, assess penalties as for
Mind-Sending. The spell cannot
work across time, dimensions,
interplanetary space, etc.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain, for a
2-way link. Same cost for each
additional person added.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Mind-Sending.

Item
Cap, crown, helmet, or other headgear. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 2,000.

Duration: The memory takes one
second to relive (although it may seem
like more to the subject).

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Mind-Sending and IQ
11+.

Borrow Skill
Regular
The caster gains a skill at (controlling attribute)+4 or increases his existing skill by 4 levels – whichever is
more. Caster’s skill cannot become
higher than subject’s skill. Subject
must be willing, and know the skill in
question. Will not work on languages
or spells.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Lend Skill.

Item
(a) Headgear. Every time it is put
on, the wearer relives his worst or best
memory (creator’s decision, but GM’s
judgment as to which memory that
turns out to be). Energy cost to create:
350. (b) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
400.

Compel Truth
Information; Resisted by Will
The subject becomes unable to lie,
though he may keep silent or tell partial truths (this must be roleplayed).
The spell does not force him to volunteer information; he merely cannot
say anything he believes to be untrue.
Duration: 5 minutes.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Truthsayer.

Item
Torc or heavy necklace; the wearer
cannot lie. Energy cost to create: 600.

Compel Lie
Regular; Resisted by Will
As listed under Mind Control Spells,
p. 137.

Insignificance
Regular; Special Resistance
Causes all beings with whom the
subject has social contact to ignore or
disregard him. Only beings who have
a reason to notice that particular person or someone in his particular situation can resist the spell with Per – the
subject himself does not get to resist.
Viewers get a bonus to their resistance
roll equal to the subject’s total
Appearance modifier, whether positive
or negative. Thus, viewers of an
Attractive subject resist with Per+1,
but viewers of an Unattractive subject
also resist with Per+1.
The spell’s effects are limited in
magnitude; the subject could slip
unnoticed through a crowd, but would
be stopped by guards if trying to go
where he should not. He can get someone’s attention by grabbing him, but is
then likely to get a negative reaction. If
he steals something or commits some
other objectionable act (removing his
clothing, perhaps), all witnesses get a
new resistance roll. If he attacks someone, that person is automatically
released from the spell – furthermore,
the victim’s cries for help won’t be
ignored!
Insignificance and Presence resist
each other.

does not get to resist! The spell does
not guarantee a good reaction from
those it affects – it doubles the positive
or negative modifier! If he has no positive or negative modifiers, it gives him
a +1 modifier. Most people will
assume, if a person stands out for no
reason that they can put their fingers
on, that there must be something
worth seeing.
Someone affected by this spell can
easily be followed in a crowd or along
city streets. The searcher can simply
ask bystanders, “Did you see so-and-so
come by here?” and quickly resume
the pursuit.
Presence and Insignificance resist
each other.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Persuasion and Lure.

Communication (VH)
Regular
This spell allows the caster to set
up two-way communication with the
subject. Each participant sees an
image of the other, allowing “realtime” conversation. Use the longdistance modifiers (p. 14) unless the
caster knows the subject and the subject was expecting the “call,” in which
case no distance modifiers apply!
Apply an additional -4 to skill if the
caster does not know the subject.
The communication is audio-visual
only. However, if the caster also knows
Far-Tasting and Odor, he may add
smell to the communication for an
extra point of energy (both for casting
and maintenance).
Others can join the “conference” at
any time – a new casting of the spell
(by anyone involved) is required for
each new person to enter.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain. Same cost for each additional person joining the communication.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisites: Wizard Eye, Far- Hearing, Voices, and Simple Illusion.

Item
(a) Cloak, jewelry, or headgear.
Always on; the wearer is ignored!
Energy cost to create: 700. (b) Wand or
staff; usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 450.

Presence
Regular; Special Resistance
Causes all beings with whom the
subject has social contact to pay attention. Each being who attempts to
ignore the subject gets to resist the
spell with Will – but the subject himself
does not get to resist! The spell does not guarantee a good reaction from those it affects – it doubles the positive or negative modifier! If he has no pos- itive or negative modifiers, it gives him a +1 modifier. Most people will assume, if a person stands out for no reason that they can put their fingers on, that there must be something worth seeing.
Someone affected by this spell can easily be followed in a crowd or along city streets. The searcher can simply ask bystanders, “Did you see so-and-so come by here?” and quickly resume the pursuit.
Presence and Insignificance resist each other.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds. Prerequisites: Persuasion and Lure.

Item
This communication is, obviously,
not secure.

(a) Cloak, jewelry, or headgear.
Always on; the wearer attracts attention. Energy cost to create: 700. (b)
Wand or staff; usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 450.

block sound
As listed under Sound Spells, p. 174.

Machine Speech/TL
Regular
As listed under Technological Spells,

Possession (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Control Person – except the victim is unconscious throughout the “possession,” and the caster has full access to the subject’s memories, skills, and spells. While in the subject’s body, the caster has his own skills and spells, and may use all the subject’s skills, spells, and memories as though they were his own (the subject’s phys- ical skills are at -1). The caster’s own body lies unconscious during the spell, and must be safeguarded.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 10 to cast. 4 to maintain. Time to cast: 1 minute. Prerequisite: Magery 1 and either
Control Person or Beast Possession.

Soul Rider
Regular; Resisted by Will
The caster can see through the subject’s eyes, hear through his ears, etc.,
whenever he concentrates. (The caster
also remains aware of his own body
and may act normally). The caster
exerts no control whatsoever over the
subject, and does not know the subject’s thoughts. The subject must be
sapient (IQ 6 or better). Skill is at -2 if
the subject is of a different race; if the
subject is totally alien, -4 or more!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Mind-Reading.

Item
A pair of identical pieces of jewelry
– one gold, one silver. The gold one
must be worn by the caster, the silver
one by the subject. The spell can then
be cast at any time, regardless of distance. Usable only by mages. If a
Powerstone is included in the item, it
is in the gold one. If either item is broken, the other loses its enchantment.
Cost to create: 1,000 energy (for the
pair), and a $100 opal for each piece.

Control Person
Regular; Resisted by Will
Use all the victim’s senses and control all the victim’s physical actions
(the caster has no access to the subject’s memories, skills, spells, etc.). The
subject retains his memory and wits
and is aware of what is happening –
though not of the caster’s identity. The
caster can only “animate” one body at a time, and must concentrate to con- trol the subject’s body. When he con- centrates, his own body falls limp; when he stops concentrating, the sub- ject regains control of his own body. The caster can move between the bodies freely while the spell lasts.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds. Prerequisite: Soul Rider or
Telepathy.

Prerequisite: Soul Rider, Possession, or (GM’s option) “holy” religious
status.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The item must touch the

possessed subject. Energy cost to
create: 300.

Permanent Possession (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Possession – but the caster
remains in the body of the subject until
he chooses to leave, or is expelled by
Dispel Possession or Remove Curse.
The caster’s own body is in Suspended
Animation (p. 94) while the spell continues. If the caster’s body dies, the spell
is broken. Whenever the subject body
takes damage, the caster must roll vs.
his own body’s HT, or take the same
damage. If the subject body dies, the
caster must roll vs. HT or die himself!
Duration: Indefinite (could be permanent).
Cost: 30.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Possession.

Item
Cap, crown, helmet, or other headgear. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 3,000.

Exchange Bodies (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
The caster permanently exchanges
bodies with the subject. The subject
may be any living creature. The only
way this spell can be reversed, once it
has been cast, is to cast it again; Dispel
Possession or other anti-magic will
not work. The attributes of ST, DX,
and HT, as well as all physical advantages and disadvantages, go with the
body; IQ, memory, personality, and all
skills and spells go with the mind.
Note: Exchange Bodies may result
in the caster increasing his point
value. The GM may wish to charge the
old wizard for the difference in character point value. See Mind Transfer
(p. B296) for more on this. To help
keep body-hopping wizards under
control, the GM may wish to require
some rare spell materials for this spell
(p. 8).
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 120.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisites: Permanent Possession and Soul Jar.


Seek Earth
Information
Tells the caster the direction and approximate distance
of the nearest significant
amount of any one type of
earth, metal, or stone. Use the
long-distance
modifiers
(p. 14). Any known sources of
that material may be excluded
if the caster specifically mentions them before beginning.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.

Item
A forked stick with an ounce of the
desired earth/stone/metal set in the tip;
each stick will find only that one kind
of earth. Cost to create: 50 energy, and
cash to buy an ounce of the material
sought.

Shape Earth
Regular
Move earth about and shape it into
any form. If the form is stable (e.g., a
hill), it will permanently remain after
shaping. An unstable form (e.g., a column or wall) lasts only while the spell
continues – no special concentration
is required – and then collapses. An
Architecture roll may be required to
create a stable form.
Earth moved with this spell travels
at only Move 2; stone travels at Move
1. It can harm no one except by flowing over an immobile person and
burying him. If earth is moved onto a
person to bury him – or from beneath
him, to create a hole – he may move
normally on his next turn, to escape.
He is trapped only if he fails to do so.
Anyone buried in loose earth by
this spell may try to claw his way out.
One roll, at ST-4, is allowed per second. GMs may make this roll harder if
the victim is buried under more than 2
cubic yards of earth! The victim can
hold his breath (see Holding Your
Breath, p. B351), but he eventually
risks suffocation (see Suffocation,
p. B436). A victim buried in stone may
hold his breath, but unless he has
some means of digging through solid
stone, escape is unlikely.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 per cubic yard of earth
shaped (minimum 2). Half that to
maintain (round up). Double cost to
shape stone; sextuple cost to shape cut
or worked stone, like a wall. It’s not
easy to make your own door into the
castle.
Prerequisite: Seek Earth.

Item
Staff, wand, piece of jewelry, or digging tool. Energy cost to create: 200
(500 for an item that will shape stone).

Seek Pass
Information
Tells the caster the direction and
approximate distance of the nearest
pass through a mountain range. Use
the long-distance modifiers (p. 14).

Earth Vision
Regular
See through the earth – to find caves, bodies of ore, buried treasure, entombed victims, etc. Earth and
uncut stone (up to 50 yards deep) are
transparent to the subject, wherever
he looks. Metal is not transparent; neither are cut stone, bricks, etc. Thus,
this spell won’t let you look through
castle walls.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 30 seconds.
Cost: 2 per 10 yards of depth to
cast. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Earth.

Item
Any. Energy cost to create: 400.

Earth to Stone
Regular
Turns an item of earth or clay into
hard stone (but not gemstone), or
turns an item of stone into a simple
metal like bronze or iron. For double
energy cost, turns an item of earth or
clay into metal.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 3 per cubic yard (minimum
3).

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.
The item must touch the victim for the
spell to work.

Stone to Earth
Regular
Turns any kind of stone (including
gemstone) into simple earth. Must be
cast on a whole stone or block, rather
than a part of it. This spell also transmutes metal into stone, or transmutes
metal into earth for double cost.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 6 per cubic yard (minimum
6).

Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 300.

Prerequisites: Earth to Stone or any
four Earth spells.

Item

Create Earth
Regular
Create good, solid earth where
none existed before. This earth must
be created in contact with the ground
– not hanging in the air or floating in
the sea!
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2 per cubic yard to create
earth from nothingness (minimum 2);
1 per cubic yard to solidify mud into
good earth (minimum 1).
Prerequisite: Earth to Stone.

Item

Earth to Air
Regular
As listed under Air Spells p. 25.

Earth Vision
Regular
See through the earth – to find caves, bodies of ore, buried treasure, entombed victims, etc. Earth and
uncut stone (up to 50 yards deep) are transparent to the subject, wherever he looks. Metal is not transparent; nei- ther are cut stone, bricks, etc. Thus, this spell won’t let you look through castle walls.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 30 seconds.
Cost: 2 per 10 yards of depth to cast. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Earth.

Flesh to Stone
Regular; Resisted by HT
“Petrifies” a living subject (and all
his gear!), turning him to stone. Must
affect the entire subject.

Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Shape
Earth.

Staff or wand. Energy cost to create:
500.

Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Seek Earth.

Predict Earth Movement
Information
Accurately predicts any landslides,
earthquakes, or volcanic activity likely
to occur within a given area over a
given period. It gives approximate
information regarding the nature,
location, and severity of the impending disaster. This spell cannot forecast
magically created earthquakes or
volcanoes.
Cost: 2 times the length of the forecast in days. Double the cost for a
place outside the local area (beyond
the horizon). Quadruple the cost for a
place on another continent.
Time to cast: 5 seconds per day of
forecast.
Prerequisite: Four Earth spells.

Sand Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin jet of sand particles
from one hand. Each turn, the caster
rolls versus DX-4 or Innate Attack skill
to hit. This attack may be dodged or
blocked, but not parried. If the spell
strikes the face, it causes no injury, but
temporarily blinds the target unless he
makes a HT roll.
If he fails the HT roll, he is blinded
(see Visibility, p. B394) for one second
per energy point put into the spell.
After the target can see again, blurry
vision gives him a -3 penalty to all
combat skills for a further 1d seconds.
On a critically failed HT roll, the target
is blinded for 1d seconds per point put
into the spell. On a successful HT roll,
the victim closes his eyes for the duration of the spell, and is thus unable to
see for one second. On a critical
success, the victim is unaffected.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. The jet’s range in yards
is equal to the energy put into it. Cost
to maintain is the same.
Prerequisite: Create Earth.

Item
Jewelry, staff, or wand; usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 600.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The jet issues from the item’s
tip. Energy cost to create: 600.

Stone Missile
Missile
Create a ball of stone and fire it from one hand, injuring anything it hits. This spell has 1⁄2D 40, Max 80, Acc 2.
Cost: Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for 3 sec- onds. The missile does 1d + 1 crushing damage per energy point.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Create Earth.

Item

Mud Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin jet of mud from one
finger. Each turn, the caster rolls versus DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit.
This attack may be dodged or blocked,
but not parried. It does knockback on
all targets; it can kill or knock down
flying swarm creatures. It will
extinguish a one-yard-radius area of
normal fire.
If the spell strikes the face, it temporarily blinds the target (see
Visibility, p. B394) unless he makes a
HT roll. If he fails the HT roll, each
energy point in the spell blinds him for
one second. After the target can see
again, blurry vision gives him a -3
penalty to all combat skills for a further 1d seconds. On a critical failure of
the HT roll, the target is blinded for 1d
seconds per point in the spell. On a
successful HT roll, the victim covers
his eyes and is therefore unable to see
for one second. On a critical success,
the victim is unaffected.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. Does 1d of knockback for every point used. Range is equal to the number of dice. Cost to maintain is the same.
Prerequisites: Water Jet and Create Earth, or Create Water and Sand Jet.

Item

Earth to Water
Regular
Turns earth to mud (or water).
Various uses of this spell include bogging down enemies or pursuers, making mud packs to treat insect stings,
softening earth to use for clay
dummies or decoys, etc.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 per cubic yard of earth
turned into mud. Double to turn earth
into water.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Create
Water, and Shape Earth.

Stone Missile
Missile
Create a ball of stone and fire it
from one hand, injuring anything it
hits. This spell has 1⁄2D 40, Max 80,
Acc 2.
Cost: Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for 3 sec- onds. The missile does 1d + 1 crushing damage per energy point.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Create Earth.

Item


Partial Petrifaction (VH)
Melee; Resisted by HT
Turns part of a living subject to stone, usually leaving him immobile but still able to talk or be tortured. The caster must touch the subject. The body parts changed are at the discre- tion of the caster; the spell can petrify anything from a single finger to the entire body from the neck down, but the head can never be affected. The subject’s metabolism is magically altered to survive the experience, but he understandably finds the experi- ence intensely uncomfortable, what- ever else is done to him.
Petrified body parts are immobile, numb, and have DR 10. Victims of this spell suffer a DX penalty on any phys- ical action they attempt: -1 or more, depending on details of the casting and the action.
Clothes, jewelry, etc., may be “caught up” in the spell and included in the petrifaction, but magic items or anything carried in the hand or a backpack remain unchanged.
Either Stone to Flesh or Remove Curse is required to negate this spell.
Duration: Permanent (until negat- ed).
Cost: 12. It costs more to petrify larger subjects, just as if it were a Regular spell (i.e., 24 energy for SM +1, 36 energy for SM +2, etc.)
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Flesh to Stone.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only by mages; the item must touch the subject. Energy cost to create: 1,300.


Walk Through Earth
Regular
Pass through earth as if it were air.
With this spell, the subject could walk
through the stone wall of a dungeon
or the earthen wall of a hut. This spell
does not open a passage so that others
can follow. It also doesn’t reveal what
is on the other side. If the caster also
knows Earth to Air, he will automatically have breathing air during his
journey, at no energy cost. Otherwise,
he must hold his breath!
Should the spell end before the subject regains the open air, he is buried in
earth or stone, as the case may be. He
is not automatically harmed, but will
suffocate (see Suffocation, p. B436) if
he cannot escape.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Double cost to pass through stone.
Triple cost to pass through metal.
Prerequisites: Four Earth spells.

Item
Gray cloak or silver jewelry; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 1,200.

Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 500.

Rain of Stones
Area
Stones rain from the sky onto the area, causing 1d-1 crushing damage per second to all within it. Characters and creatures under the rain of stones take damage on their own turns; if less than an entire second is spent in the affected area, damage is halved (round down).
The spell can only be cast outdoors. Armor protects in the usual fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the stones, but it may take damage (p. B484). This requires two hands and a Ready action, and succeeds automatically in protecting the character once the shield is readied upward, but this unreadies the shield from its normal protective functions!
Inanimate objects, such as build- ings, protect with their DR.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1 to cast (minimum 2). Same cost to maintain. For double base cost, the Rain of Stones does 2d- 2 per second!
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Create Earth.
Item
Staff. Usable only by mages. Energy cost to create: 500.

Essential Earth
Regular
Creates the magical essence of Earth. Essential Earth is three times as fertile: plants germinate three times faster and grow three times taller or bigger than normal. In addition, if Essential Earth is transformed into stone via the Earth to Stone spell, it will be three times as strong (DR and HP); columns or blocks cut from such stone would support three times as much weight. This Essential Stone is similar to the legendary material adamant, discussed in more detail in GURPS Fantasy.
If Essential Earth is transformed into metal via Earth to Stone, that Essential Metal will also have triple the strength (HP, DR, and carrying capacity) of normal metal; this is sim- ilar to the legendary alloy orichalcum, discussed in more detail in GURPS Fantasy.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 8.
Time to cast: 30 seconds. Prerequisites: Six Earth spells.

Entombment
Regular; Resisted by HT
The earth instantly swallows the
subject. He remains in Suspended
Animation (as per p. 94), in a tiny
spherical chamber 50 feet underground, until rescued by tunneling or
the reverse of this spell. A mage who
casts Entombment on himself may
elect to stay awake, but this is unwise
unless he has some means of breathing
while entombed!
Duration: Permanent,
reversed by this spell.
Cost: 10 (but only 6 to reverse an entombment).
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and five Earth spells.

Stone to Flesh
Regular
Reverses the effects of Flesh to
Stone and brings the victim back to
life (stunned). Cannot be used to
animate a statue that was never alive.
Duration: Instantaneous.
Cost: 10. Double cost to restore a
person turned to metal.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Flesh to
Stone, and Stone to Earth.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.
The item must touch the victim for the
spell to work.

Body of Stone (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
Subject becomes an animated
stone statue; he temporarily acquires
the Body of Stone meta-trait
(p. B262). Clothes also become stone,
but carried equipment does not.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 10 to cast. 5 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Stone to Flesh.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,500.

Steelwraith
Regular; Resisted by HT
Renders the subject intangible to
the touch of metal. Swords pass
through him, he cannot hold metal
keys or to wear metal armor, he passes
through bars and metal floors . . .
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 7 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Walk
Through Earth.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
1,200. (b) A metallic weapon may be
enchanted to counter the spell (so that
it may be wielded by or against a
Steelwraithed being). Energy cost to
create: 250 per pound of weight (minimum 1 pound).
occupants, but won’t wreck the building. Cost depends on strength of the
quake:

Purify Earth
Area
Removes foreign objects, poisons, and harmful elements from soil, ren- dering it fit to support growing plants. This spell also remedies any deficien- cies in the soil’s composition. Small foreign objects (coins, nails) under- ground are destroyed; medium ones (swords, artillery shells, chests, stat- uettes) “float” to the surface. Large objects (coffins, walls, large statues) will cause the spell to fail, but the cast- er gets a general idea of the reason.
This is also a Plant spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Base cost: 2. Double cost in poor soil such as rocky flats or sandy desert.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Create Earth and Plant Growth.

Item
Staff. Energy cost to create: 400.

Sandstorm
Area
As listed under Air Spells, p. 27.

Earthquake
Area
Shakes the affected area. The caster probably won’t want the area to
include him. Divide the actual distance from caster to edge of affected
area by 20 before figuring the skill
penalty.
The spell must be cast over a fairly
large area to be useful. Shaking one
corner of a building will upset the
occupants, but won’t wreck the build- ing. Cost depends on strength of the quake:
Tiny: Just a demonstration – a slight swaying. Pay base cost.
Mild: Slight damage to buildings. Multiply base cost by 2. DX roll required, every second, for those in affected area to keep their feet.
Severe: Stone walls crack; towers may fall. Multiply base cost by 4. DX- 3 roll required, every second, for those in affected area to keep their feet.
Duration: One minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least six Earth spells, including Earth Vision.

Volcano
Regular
Causes vapor and lava to spew
from a chosen spot of ground. This is
not a quick spell, but it is very serious!
The volcano starts out small – a small
hole spitting stones and vapors – and
increase its diameter by a couple of
yards per day. This spell can also reactivate a dormant volcano. When the
spell is allowed to lapse, the volcano
ceases to grow and will soon die (a formerly dormant volcano may stay
active at the GM’s discretion).
Duration: One day.
Cost: 15 to cast. 10 to maintain.
Time to cast: One hour until the first
effects are visible. Continued
concentration for 8 hours each day is
necessary to keep the volcano growing.
Prerequisites: Earthquake and at
least six Fire spells.

Alter Terrain (VH)
Area
Can be used to completely transform vast amounts of terrain. If cast
over a large enough area, this spell can
turn a city into a lake or sea, or an offshore island into a mountain range.
The profile of the ground (including sea, lake, or river beds) within the
affected area can be raised, lowered,
or reshaped as the caster chooses, or
changed in texture to anything
between soft earth and sand to hard
granite. Stone or brick buildings and
vegetable matter can all be transformed into “natural” stone or earth,
but not vice-versa. Submerged areas
raised above their natural level
become dry land; any area lowered
below the local water table may be
flooded. The GM should require
Architecture, Artist, or Engineer rolls
if the caster tries to alter the area into
something specific.
Beings and loose items on the surface at the time the spell is cast are
simply raised or lowered, with no personal injury. If they are inside buildings, they are gently expelled rather
than entombed. Of course, if they find
themselves under water, they may
have problems . . .
If the spell is countered or dispelled, the whole area returns to its
former condition; even transformed
buildings and trees are restored.
Duration: 2d days.
Base cost: 1 to cast (minimum cost
15). Cannot be maintained. Volumes
taller than 4 yards may be affected by
multiplying the base cost accordingly.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and all four
elemental “Shape” spells.

Item
An area may be permanently
altered for 100 times casting cost.

Move Terrain (VH)
Area; Special Resistance
Enables an entire area of terrain,
with all buildings, animals, plants, and
people on or in it, to be moved over
large distances. Once the spell is cast,
the area to be transported vanishes
(see below), replaced by bare earth or
open water. The caster is now “carrying” that area in invisible, intangible
form (this fact can be determined by
Detect Magic or something similar).
Beings caught in the affected area have
a resistance roll based on the best Will
among them, modified by -1 for every
additional yard of radius of the subject
area (thus, Move Terrain with a 2-yard
radius is resisted by Will-1). Successful
resistance negates the spell.
Once the casting is successfully
completed, the subject area “shrinks”
in radius at the rate of 1 yard per second, moving toward the caster at the
same rate. Victims quick enough on
their feet should be able to jump out of
the area as it shrinks (this has good
dramatic potential) – make DX and IQ
rolls! GMs may decide this warrants a
Fright Check.
Beings caught by the spell are
aware of a wild, swirling sky above
their heads and a physically impenetrable barrier all around them. The
atmosphere inside remains breathable
and comfortable (so this spell cannot
be used to suffocate someone!). Spells
cast out of the area automatically hit
the Move Terrain’s holder – thus, a
trapped mage could walk up to the
affected area’s edge, lay his hand
against the barrier, and cast
Deathtouch at the holder! Captive
mages could also cast Dispel Magic or
Counterspell on the affected area,
forcing the spell to end abruptly if they
are successful.
When the caster stops maintaining
the spell, the terrain reappears. The
caster’s location falls anywhere within
it or at its edge. The subject area
“expands” back to normal size at the
same rate it shrank. If there is no suitable space available, anything in the
way is moved aside as if by Shape
Earth.
The caster may not use this spell
again for one full day. The subject area
or any part of it cannot be moved
again by this spell (from any caster or
magic item) for the same period.
Cast over a large enough area, this
spell can place mountains in the middle of plains, open water (as deep as
half the radius of effect, transported
from lake or ocean) in the midst of a
desert – or shift islands miles inland to
form hills!
Duration: 1 hour. (The effects, once
the area is “placed,” are permanent.)
Base cost: 10 to cast. 8 to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Alter Terrain and
Hide Object.

Item
Staff. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 3,000.

Enchant (VH)
Enchantment
A prerequisite for all other
Enchantment spells except Scroll. To
enchant an item, the caster must also
know this spell. The caster rolls
against the lower of his skill with this
spell and the specific spell he wishes to
place on the item. If he has assistants,
they must have skill 15 or higher with
both spells, but the roll is based on the
caster’s skill.
Duration: Magic items are
permanent until destroyed.
Cost and Time: See Enchanting
(p. 16).
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
one spell from each of 10 other colleges.

Temporary Enchantment
Enchantment
This lets the enchanter create
magic items that only function a few
times before losing their enchantment,
at a substantial savings in energy cost
(and therefore time).
An item can be temporarily
enchanted at an energy cost of 15%
the normal cost for an item of that
type per use. An item with only a single use can be created for 15% of the
normal energy, two uses would cost
30%, four would cost 60% (very costineffective under most circumstances)
and the cost for an item limited to 7 or
more uses actually exceeds the cost of
a permanent item.
The temporarily enchanted item
acts, in all respects, as a normal item
of that type until all of its uses are consumed. Once all the uses of the temporary item are gone, the item is no
longer magical.
The Temporary Enchantment spell
is used in place of the Enchant spell. A
single item may not be enchanted with
both temporary and permanent spells
simultaneously.
Temporary Enchantment can only
be used to give items a one-time ability to cast a certain spell – not to cast
the spell on the object. For example, a
mage couldn’t make a one-shot set of
invisible armor – it would never wear
off. He could give the armor the ability to cast the Invisibility spell on itself
at normal energy and duration costs.
Temporary Enchantment cannot
be used in conjunction with any
Enchantment college or Meta-Spell
college spells except the following:
Hex, Limit, Link, Name, Power, and
Speed. Temporary Enchantment
absolutely cannot be used to further
reduce the cost of enchantments that
already have limited uses (e.g., SkullSpirit).
Duration: Until all of the item’s
uses have been expended.
Cost and time: See Enchanting, p. 16.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Scroll
Enchantment
Write a magical scroll charged with
a spell from one of the other colleges.
If a mage who understands the scroll’s
language at Accented comprehension
or better reads it aloud, the scroll casts
its spell, after which its power dissipates and the writing on the scroll
vanishes. Reading a scroll requires
twice the normal casting time for the
spell; the mage reading the scroll pays
the normal energy cost. No skill roll is
required when the spell is read unless
it is Resisted. In that case, roll using
the skill level of the mage who wrote
the scroll.
Pronunciation is important when
reading a scroll aloud! If the mage
reading the scroll has Accented spoken
comprehension of the scroll’s language, the scroll casts its spell at a -1
penalty; if he has Broken spoken comprehension, the scroll casts at -3. If he
has None, he cannot articulate the
words properly and cannot cast the
spell.
A scroll can be read silently, to see
what it says. Any mage who understands the language will know what
spell it is supposed to be. This does not
cast the spell!
Spells may be written on any material, but parchment is traditional.
Damage to a scroll does not affect its
power as long as the scroll is legible.
Time to cast: The number of days
needed to write a scroll is equal to the
energy cost required to cast the spell
originally (base cost for area spells),
not counting any bonuses for skill.
Multiply this by $33 (or the setting’s
usual per-point enchantment rate; see
pp. 21-22) to get the normal market
value of the scroll.
Example: The Rear Vision spell
normally costs 3 energy to cast. A Rear
Vision scroll would take 3 full days to
write, and would normally cost $100.
At the end of the writing time, the GM
rolls against the writer’s skill with
Scroll or the spell being written –
whichever is lower. A successful roll
means the spell is good. A failure
means the scroll will not work. A critical failure means it will cast a flawed
spell!
Duration: As long as the spell
would normally last. The mage who
reads the scroll can maintain the spell,
if it could normally be maintained.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and must
have at least Accented written comprehension in the language the scroll is to
be written in. A mage may not write a
scroll for a spell he does not know.

Hex
Enchantment
Makes the item impossible to put
down/take off/get out of/etc. In itself,
this effect is merely inconvenient, and
can even be useful – for instance, you
will never drop a hexed weapon, and a
hexed pair of glasses will never fall off.
However, if the hexed object has
another malign spell on it, it becomes
much more dangerous. The hex effect
is “always on.”
To escape from a hexed object, you
must remove or suppress the enchantment, find someone to cast a Remove
Curse spell, or amputate the body part
involved. Attempts to break or cut off
the hexed item will fail (or result in
amputation). GMs should permit this
rule to have illogical results, if necessary, to keep the hexed object on the
victim. Hexes aren’t logical!
A hex may be limited by a Link or
Password spell. For instance, a ring
could be made with a Hex, the Strike
Blind spell, and the password
“Gesundheit.” Anyone wearing the
ring would go blind – but should they
say the magic word, the ring would
fall off!
Energy cost to create: 200.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Power
Enchantment
Makes a magic item partially or
completely “self-powered.” Each point
of Power reduces the energy cost to
cast or to maintain any spell on the
item by one. Halve this bonus in a lowmana area (round down); double it in
a high- or very-high-mana area. Power
has no effect on the energy cost of the
user’s spells!
If Power reduces the cost to maintain a spell to zero, treat the item as
“always on” after the cost to cast is
paid – but the wearer must stay awake
to maintain the spell. If Power reduces
the cost to cast to zero, the item is
“always on” for all purposes, although
the owner may turn it off if he wishes.
Energy Cost: See table below.
Power: 1, Cost: 500
Power: 2, Cost: 1000
Power: 3, Cost: 2000
Power: 4, Cost: 4000

Double the cost for each additional
point. May be recast at a higher level,
as per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisites: Enchant and Recover
Energy.

Speed
Enchantment
Decreases the casting time of any
other enchantments on an item
enchanted with Speed. Each point of
Speed cuts the casting time in half,
just as high skill does for a mage. If the
casting time is reduced below 1 second, the item can be used to cast the
spell without concentration.
Energy Cost: See table below.
Power: 1, Cost: 500
Power: 2, Cost: 1000
Power: 3, Cost: 2000
Power: 4, Cost: 4000

Double the cost for each additional
point. May be recast at a higher level,
as per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisites: Enchant and Haste.

Remove Enchantment
Enchantment
Takes one enchantment spell off
the subject item. This does not affect
other enchantments on that same
item. Exception: A failed attempt to
remove a Limiting Enchantment
removes all enchantments from the
item.
spells or be present for the entire
casting.
Skill modifiers: -3 if the caster does
not know how to cast the enchantment he is trying to remove. -3 if he
does not know exactly what that spell
is. -3 for each other spell on the item.
These are cumulative.
Duration: Removal is permanent.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Lesser Wish (VH)
Enchantment
This spell, like the more powerful
Wish spells, must be cast on a
ring, amulet, or jewel. The wearer of
that item may then specify the result
of any one die roll made in his presence, just before that roll is made –
except a die roll involving magic. This
is not an “action.” It takes no time, and
may be done at any time. Once used, a
wish is lost.
Only one roll or action can be
affected by one wish; you could use a
wish on your attack roll or on the
damage, but not both. GMs should
feel free to disallow any wish use that
they consider abusive or imbalancing.
Cost: 180.
Prerequisite: Enchant

Suspend Enchantment
Enchantment
As Remove Enchantment, but the
enchantment is merely suppressed. It
seems to vanish, but reappears when
the Suspend Enchantment spell ends.
If anyone attempts to study or detect a
suspended enchantment, it resists the
information spell at -5.
Skill modifiers: -3 if the caster does
not know how to cast the enchantment he is trying to suspend. -3 if he
does not know exactly what that spell
is. -3 for each other spell on the item.
These are cumulative.
Duration: One hour.
Cost: 25 or 1/100 of the cost to
place the enchantment originally,
whichever is more. Half this amount
to maintain.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Resist Enchantment
Enchantment
An item enchanted with this spell
resists attempts to enchant it further,
imposing a penalty on the enchantment skill roll. Further, this enchantment itself resists any attempt to
remove or suspend it, imposing twice
the regular penalty.
It is possible for the enchanter to
set Resist Enchantment to not resist
specific further enchantments, but the
enchanter himself must cast those
spells or be present for the entire casting.
Energy Cost: See table below.
Penalty: -1, Cost: 50
Penalty: -2, Cost: 100
Penalty: -3, Cost: 200
Penalty: -4, Cost: 500
Penalty: -5, Cost: 1000

Item


Talisman
Enchantment
A talisman is an item that grants
the wearer a one-time boon when
attacked by a specific spell or nonmagical attack or affliction. The talisman’s
enchantment adds to the resistance
roll, attribute check, or defense roll
against its specific attack or affliction.
The talisman is always “on” while
worn by or in physical contact with its
owner; otherwise it is inactive. It lasts
until the thing it protects against happens; then it loses its enchantment.
Talismans may protect against disease,
arrows, curses, lightning, and other
calamities.
Although most talismans are created using pieces of jewelry, any item
may be so enchanted. It is even possible to tattoo a talisman onto its wearer! When creating a talisman against a
spell, the enchanter uses the lower of
his skills with Talisman and the spell
being opposed.
Each protection is a different spell,
to be learned separately. Talismans
also work against variants of the base
spell: a talisman against Fireball also
works against Explosive Fireball.
Alchemists can create magical
objects called talismans (p. 220); they
are, however, not the same as the
items produced by this spell.
Energy Cost: See table below.
Protection: 1, Cost: 15
Protection: 2, Cost: 45
Protection: 3, Cost: 90
Protection: 4, Cost: 150
Prerequisites: Enchant and the spell
to be opposed by the talisman (if any).

Amulet
Enchantment
An amulet is an item that grants
the wearer magic resistance against a
specific spell. Amulets are often
enchanted with several Amulet spells,
to cover a wide spectrum of effects.
Although most amulets are pieces of
jewelry, any item may be so enchanted. It is even possible to tattoo an
amulet onto its wearer!
The enchanter uses the lower of his
skills with Amulet and the spell being
opposed. Amulets also work against
variants of the base spell: an amulet
against Fireball also works against
Explosive Fireball.
Alchemists can create magical
objects called amulets (p. 220);
although they have a similar function,
they are not the same as the items
produced by this spell.
Energy cost to cast: 50 per point of
magic resistance the amulet grants
(maximum of 5).
Prerequisite: The appropriate
Talisman spell (that is, to learn the
Amulet spell to protect from Panic, the
caster must know the Talisman spell
for Panic).

Adjustable Clothing
Enchantment
Causes an item of clothing to
adjust to fit whoever wears it, within
limits. The adjustment occurs as the
wearer begins to put it on, so the
enchantment won’t be discovered if someone picks up the item and imme- diately discards it as “obviously” the wrong size. When removed, the item returns to its original size. The change in size does change weight as well; an object that doubled in size would increase in weight eightfold.
This enchantment is rare; few enchanters need to make “any size fits all” enchanted clothing. It is some- times found in extremely expensive theatrical costumes. It is also used when the item is intended to outlive its original wearer, and often commis- sioned for intended heirlooms.
Energy cost to cast: The cost to enchant a cloth shirt or pair of pants that can increase or decrease in every dimension by 10% is 50. This cost varies widely depending on size, mate- rials, and adaptability; round fractions up.
For gloves, boots, shoes, a belt, a hat, or similar small items, halve the cost. For something ring or earring- sized, use one-third cost. For overalls, or a full-length gown, double cost. For a pressure suit or other item that liter- ally covers the whole body, triple the cost.
An item with a few incidental metal parts (zippers, buttons, etc.) counts as “cloth,” as does thin leather. Leather thick enough to have DR dou- bles cost. Scale armor, chainmail, or similar items triple the cost. Plate armor and other solid metal clothing multiply cost by five. For exceptional- ly light clothing (a veil or lingerie), halve cost.
If the item can adjust in size by 25%, double cost. If it can halve or double in size, triple cost. If it can decrease to 1/5 size, or grow to five times size, quadruple cost.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Reshape.

Golem (VH)
Enchantment
Create and animate a permanent
servant or warrior. Golems make
excellent warriors; they never grow
tired, and are immune to stunning,
pain, and the like. Likewise, there is
no known spell to “steal” a golem from
its maker. The spell is permanent; the
golem is “always on.” A golem follows
verbal orders from its maker; the
maker may instruct it to obey others.

Clay Golem
Clay is the default material for golems; it is easily molded, both physically and supernaturally. Golem enchanters often go on to work with
more difficult materials – stone, plastic, flesh – but if a golem is needed
in a hurry, most enchanters return to clay.

Clay Golem
0 points
Attribute Modifiers: ST+5 [50]; DX+1 [20]; IQ-2 [-40]; HT+4 [40].
Advantages: Doesn’t Breathe [20]; Doesn’t Eat or Drink [10]; Doesn’t
Sleep [20]; High Pain Threshold [10]; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards
[30]; Injury Tolerance (Homogenous, No Blood) [45]; Single-Minded
[5]; Unaging [15]; Unfazeable [15]; Vacuum Support [5].
Disadvantages: Automaton [-85]; Cannot Learn [-30]; Disturbing Voice
[-10]; No Sense of Smell/Taste [-5]; Reprogrammable [-10]; Social
Stigma (Valuable Property) [-10]; Unhealing (Total) [-30]; Unnatural
[-50]; Wealth (Dead Broke) [-25].
Features: Neither has nor spends Fatigue Points.
Skills: 10 points of skills appropriate to the golem’s intended function
[10].

Golems make excellent warriors; they never
grow tired, and are immune to stunning, pain,
and the like.

It understands only one language
(which must be spoken by the caster).
It takes no initiative, and ignores any
situation for which it has been given
no orders. However, it never forgets
anything it sees or is told.
Golems do not heal on their own,
and are destroyed if reduced to -HP.
They may be repaired with Healing
spells (except Resurrection) if cast by
the golem’s creator. There is no other
way to repair a golem. To create a
golem, the creator must make its body
– doing all the work himself – then
animate it with this spell. Once animated, a golem lasts until reduced to 0
HP or until its creator commands it to
cease functioning. No concentration
or maintenance is required to control
a golem.
A basic clay golem (see box) costs
250 energy to enchant. A more powerful golem costs an additional 2
energy for every extra character point
of abilities added to the golem. In
most cases, additional abilities should
be restricted to extra ST, HP, and DR
(a rule of thumb: 20 points of energy
buys 1 ST, 5 HP, or 2 DR); however,
GMs may allow more sweeping
changes to the basic golem if they feel
comfortable doing so. More powerful
golems may require more durable
(and more costly) materials, adding to
the cost and time required to create
the golem’s body. (Optionally, the GM
may allow less powerful golems;
golems worth less than 0 points cost 2
less energy for every character point
below zero, to a minimum of 130
energy.)
Energy cost to cast: 250 or more.
Prerequisites: Enchant, Shape
Earth, and Animation. Other spells
may be necessary to work with unusual materials, such as Shape Plant for a
wood golem or Restoration for a flesh
golem.

Impression Blocker
Enchantment
Seeker (p. 105) and related spells
require an object associated with the
item or person sought in order to
work. The Impression Blocker
Enchantment creates a container that
allows people to carry items without
them becoming “associated” with the
carrier.
An object in a closed blocker container retains the impressions it had
when the container was shut. If
removed, handled briefly, and
replaced, the object will acquire a very
faint impression of the handler, but it
won’t be enough for a Seeker spell
unless the handler does so once a day
for decades. It is possible for an object
in a blocker container still to be useful;
for example, a book open to an important page, and stored in a glass container, can still be read! At sufficiently
advanced tech levels, a “waldo” or
remote-manipulation box can be
enchanted, allowing handling of the
object without opening the box.
In some settings, these containers
can also be used to preserve evidence.
If an object is owned for one person
for a long time, and then transferred
to a new owner, the original owner’s
impressions may wear off. A blocker
container preserves the original
owner’s impressions. (In other settings, impressions never wear off; they
just accumulate, so an item can be
used to cast Seeker on any previous
owner.)
Energy cost to cast: 20 per pound of
capacity, minimum 20.
Prerequisites: Enchant, Seeker, and
Scrywall.

Malefice (VH)
Enchantment
Through this foul enchantment,
the caster can put a victim under his
thrall. He must fashion a doll (usually
out of wax, but clay, straw, and other
materials may be appropriate with the
GM’s permission) with something personally relevant to the target imbedded in it. Parts of the body (nail clippings, hair, blood, spittle, etc.) allow a
casting at base skill. Other items allow
a casting at a varying penalty; for
example, threads from a shirt worn
for years might be worth -2, while dirt
from a fresh footprint might be worth
-6.
Malefice is a lasting spell (p. 10)
that continues until its Endurance is
reduced to 0. It starts with an
Endurance equal to its caster’s
effective skill.
The doll can be used by its maker
(and no one else) to cast harmful
spells (such as Pain) on the target, at
normal energy cost, while ignoring distance penalties. The caster uses the
lower of the Malefice’s Endurance and
his skill with the channeled spell. The
target resists all such attacks, even if
the spell is normally not Resisted
(spells without normal resistance
rules are Resisted by HT when cast
through a Malefice doll).
If the victim resists the very first
spell cast upon him through the doll,
the enchantment is immediately broken. Otherwise, every successful
resistance simply weakens the
Malefice, reducing its Endurance by 1.
Upon reaching Endurance 0, the
Malefice dissipates (though the doll is
still a viable item for re-enchantment,
and its magical association with the
target offsets one point of casting
penalty). A critical failure by the channeled spell or a critical success by the
subject also breaks the enchantment,
reducing the doll’s Endurance to zero.
Destroying the doll breaks the
spell, but it also inflicts on the target a
Deathtouch (p. 41) of as many dice as
the Malefice’s current Endurance
divided by 5 (round down, maximum
of 3d). This damage occurs as long as
the Malefice has any Endurance
remaining. Remove Curse frees the
target from the Malefice without harm
to him.
Energy cost to cast: 250. The wax
and special ingredients cost $500.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Seeker.

Ensorcel (VH)
Enchantment; Special Resistance
An ensorcelment is a durable spell,
usually malign but sometimes beneficial, cast on a single being. The
process requires something that is
personally relevant to the subject; use
the modifiers listed under Malefice.
The caster’s spell roll is determined
by the lower of his skills with this spell
and the specific spell being placed on
the subject. If the caster has assistants,
their skills with both spells must be 15
or greater, but the roll is based on the
caster’s skill.
Possible ensorcelments include
quite a few Body or Mind Control
spells and others such as Shapeshift
Other, Flesh to Stone, the various
“Body of” spells, Walk on Air, the various “Resist” spells, Hide, Invisibility,
the various “Vision” spells and Plant
Form Other. In all cases, it must be a
maintainable Regular spell.
When the spell is cast, the subject
gets a resistance roll if the object spell
allows one; distance is not a factor.
Remove Curse is effective against any
ensorcelment.
The cost of the enchantment can
be reduced if the caster includes an
“escape clause” – a particular action or
condition that will break the spell.
Examples include speaking a magic
word, being kissed as a gesture of true
love, abstaining from speech for three
years, and so on. The value of the
energy reduction depends on just how
difficult the condition will be to meet
– and the “escape clause” must be at
least possible to be worth any reduction. The “discount” can be anything
from 10% (for truly difficult or unlikely conditions) to 90% (for something
that the subject could easily and
automatically do, and easily discover).
Energy cost to cast: 200 times the
casting cost of the spell being placed
on the subject.
Prerequisite: Malefice.

Spell Stone
Enchantment
A spell stone stores a spell until
someone (even a nonmage) uses it.
The stone’s user concentrates for a
second while crushing the spell stone
in his hand, thus casting the spell. At
the beginning of his next turn, roll
against the spell stone’s Power. If the
roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it
is failed, the stone is simply wasted. If
the stone is crushed without the requisite second of concentration, it is likewise wasted.
The spell’s energy is included in the
enchantment; none is required of the
user, who also may not opt to supply
any power to maintain the spell.
Likewise, he may not cancel the spell
once cast, although the creator of the
stone may specify a shorter duration
than ordinary and may also invest
extra energy into the enchantment so
that the spell will maintain itself. A
person may use only one spell stone
per second.
A spell stone must be made from a
jewel worth $10¥P2 + $40¥P, where P
is the maximum energy of the spell
that may be contained.
Any spell except a Blocking or
Enchantment spell may be stored in a
spell stone. Limiting Enchantments
may be put on the stone. If the spell
stored in the stone requires that the
caster know another spell (Counterspell, for instance), that other spell
must be specified at creation time. It is
thus possible to create a spell stone
that will counter one specific spell, but
it is impossible to create a generic
Counterspell spell stone.
It is also possible to create spell
stones which, when crushed, do not
cast the spell for the user, but on him!
Analyze Magic reveals which spell
a spell stone contains, whether the
spell will be cast for or on the caster,
how much energy was invested, etc.
(one question per casting).
Cost: 250.
Prerequisites: Lesser Wish and at
least one spell in each of 15 different
colleges.

Hideaway
Enchantment
When cast on an object, Hideaway
makes it larger inside than it is outside. Can be used on a pocket, pouch,
drawer, pitcher – anything that can
normally hold other things. The caster
may add any amount of pound-capacity he can afford, while increasing the
size of the “inside” by 2 cubic feet for
each pound; the extra space may be
hidden by a false bottom, etc.
Depending on the energy used to cast
the spell, objects within the Hideaway
may or may not count as encumbrance. The contents vanish forever if
the object is destroyed. The time
required to find an object in a
Hideaway depends on how deep it is!
A large enough Hideaway could
hold a person. There is no problem
with air unless the Hideaway is sealed
off.
Energy cost to cast: 20 times the
spell’s casting cost, including
maintenance cost if so desired.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Delay.

Wish (VH)
Enchantment
Allows the wisher to change the
very recent past. It erases any justmade die roll – except a die roll for
spell casting – and replaces it with the
wisher’s desired roll. The restrictions
on use for Lesser Wish also apply to
Wish.
Cost: 250.
Prerequisites: Lesser Wish and at least one spell in each of 15 different colleges.

Leak
Enchantment
A perversion of the Cornucopia
spell (p. 64). The bag, purse, quiver,
backpack, or other container
enchanted will have an uncanny tendency to “lose” whatever is put in it
(coins, arrows, clothes, etc.). A Leaky
purse would lose a coin or two a day,
a Leaky quiver would lose an arrow or
two a day, a Leaky back-pack would
lose a piece of equipment once in a
while . . . The lost items may “drop”
out of the container, be whisked away
by thieving magpies, or magically
vanish into thin air (as the GM’s fancy
takes him). Living beings are
unaffected.
Energy cost to cast: 100.
Prerequisite: Hideaway.

Simulacrum (VH)
Enchantment
Create a golem in the exact image
of a particular victim. The golem must
be prepared for a specific target; this
requires the incorporation of something from the original’s body (hair,
blood, etc.) into the creation.
Otherwise, any materials appropriate
for golems (clay, stone, flesh, etc.) may
be used, along with any other materials that the GM approves. An appropriate Shape spell or Artist (Sculpting)
skill roll at -10 is necessary to achieve
a good likeness – the caster need not
do this himself. The simulacrum, once
enchanted, appears identical to the
target (including such details as eye
color and skin tone) through a sort of
always-on Perfect Illusion Disguise.
The simulacrum has the same
attributes as the underlying golem.
Golems intended as simulacra are
often designed with higher IQ than
ordinary golems, to improve the
deception.
Once the simulacrum is activated,
it takes on the persona and knowledge
of the target, as the caster perceives
them. That is, the Simulacrum cannot
know something that the target does if
the caster didn’t. IQ rolls may be
required of the caster as challenges
come up (what was the name of his
great-uncle, anyway?). Like any
golem, the simulacrum is under the
direct control of the caster.
Time to build body: As for the
underlying golem, adding a week of
work.
Energy cost to activate: Double that
of the underlying golem.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Golem,
Perfect Illusion, and Illusion Disguise.

Doppelgänger (VH)
Enchantment
A Doppelgänger is a duplicate of a
person, fabricated through powerful
magic. The Doppelgänger must be
prepared for a specific target; both a
sample of the target’s body (hair,
blood, etc.) and a cherished personal
possession of the target are required.
A statue of the original must be sculpted, using some pure elemental “material” – pure ice or snow from a mountaintop, stone or fire from the bowels
of a volcano, and so on are all appropriate materials. The likeness is
achieved with an appropriate Shape
spell or Artist (Sculpting) skill roll at
-10.
The Doppelgänger has all the
attributes, skills, and knowledge of the
original, with the exception of magic;
it has no Magery and cannot cast any
spells. It gets its knowledge from the
embedded object; anything that the
History spell could divine, it will
know. It acts as the original would,
had the Doppelgänger’s creator
enslaved him. Suspend Curse paralyzes it, and Remove Curse destroys it.
When destroyed, all that is left is a
mass of the original material (a puddle
of water, a mound of earth, a sudden
rush of flames) and the personal
possession.
It is very difficult to detect the
trickery. Whenever the GM judges an
Information spell does not altogether
fail to tell the copy from the original,
he should let the Doppelgänger spell
resist. The Aura spell and the
Empathy advantage would be
Resisted, for example.
Time to build body: 6 weeks of
work.
Energy cost to activate: 1,000.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Golem,
History, and Enslave.

Great Wish (VH)
Enchantment
This spell can do just about anything. In particular:
(1) It can be used to cast any one
spell, at no energy cost, with automatic success and no chance of resistance
(for spells with variable cost, the maximum energy available is 1,000). The
caster does not have to know the spell,
or even have it in a book – he just has
to know the spell exists. If the spell is
a “continuing” one, it is up to the GM
to determine how long it should last.
(2) It can permanently improve a
character’s scores. It will increase any
one attribute by 1 level, or any one
skill or spell by 3 levels. It can also
reduce an enemy’s scores, but only if
that enemy is present when the wish is
made.
(3) It will grant any one advantage
worth 20 points or less, or remove any
one disadvantage worth 20 points or
less. An enemy can likewise be cursed
by losing an advantage or gaining a
disadvantage, but only if that enemy is
present when the wish is made. The
enemy does not get a chance to resist!
(4) It can do absolutely anything
else that the GM feels will not ridiculously unbalance the adventure or the
campaign!
Though incredibly powerful, this
spell is not used often. It can never be
learned at a level better than 15.
Furthermore, any failed roll when creating a Great Wish costs the caster,
and each helper, 1 point of IQ and 6d
damage! Critical failures have toppled
civilizations. Great Wishes are not
normally found for sale. If they are,
the price should be at least $100,000.
Cost: 2,000.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Wish, and
a combined DX and IQ of 30+.

Bane
Enchantment
This is also considered a Limiting
Enchantment (p. 68). It is used to
make a magical weapon with powers
that work only against one type of foe.
Successfully cast before any offensive
weapon enchantment, it reduces the
energy cost of those spells, but they
will work only against the named foe.
For instance, a sword could be made
that did +3 damage, but only against
orcs – and this would be easier to
enchant than a weapon that did +3
against everything. Note that a Bane
spell cannot be removed unless the
enchantments it controls are also
removed.
The same caster who placed the
Bane on the sword must cast the
enchantments limited by the Bane.
The more specific the bane (GM’s
decision) the greater the reduction in
the other spells’ cost(s). Banes like “All
my foes” are not allowed! Examples of
legal Banes:
Against a specific nation, religion, or
race: Divide costs by 2.
Against a specific type of creature, or
folk of a certain city: Divide costs by 3.
Against all members of one specific
family: Divide costs by 4.
Against one specific foe: Divide
costs by 10.
Energy cost to cast: 100. The caster
must also possess some item or relic
pertaining to the person, creature,
race, etc. involved.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Penetrating Weapon
Enchantment
Cutting, impaling, or piercing weapons with this enchantment pass through armor as if it were butter. Specifically, the spell grants the weapon an armor divisor (p. B268). Such a weapon does not do extra dam- age to unarmored foes. Hardened DR defends against the armor divisor conferred by this spell as normal.
Armor Divisor Cost
2:  250
3:  750
5:  2,500
10: 7,500
Ignores DR: 25,000
Energy cost to cast: Depends on the armor divisor conferred on the weapon.
Double the cost if the subject is a missile weapon (e.g., a bow). Divide the cost by 10 if subject is a missile (e.g., an arrow). If the item falls in more than one class (weapon, missile weapon, missile), use the higher enchantment cost. In addition to weapons, any sort of cutting tool may be enchanted. Note that this spell may be recast at a higher level as per Accuracy.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Find Weakness.

Graceful Weapon
Enchantment
This enchantment is a toned-down
version of Quick-Draw (below). The
item does not become unready after
attacking or parrying, even on a critical miss. If Graceful Weapon encounters Turn Blade or Bladeturning, it
resists those spells with its Power.
Energy cost to cast: 150 per pound
of weight (minimum 1 pound).
Prerequisites:
Enchant
and
Apportation.

Item
May be cast on any sort of tool –
not just a weapon.

Loyal Sword
Enchantment
The subject weapon seeks to return
to the wearer’s hand if it is dropped or
thrown – even if the wearer becomes
unable to fight. When dropped, it
returns on the next turn, as though
Quick-Drawn (below). When thrown,
it flies until it hits something or falls to
the ground, and then returns in as
straight a line as possible, with a Move
of 12. It avoids enemies and obstacles
when returning! If its owner dies, it
returns to the body – but after that, it becomes loyal to the next person to pick it up.
A loyal weapon can be trapped, captured out of the air, etc., while returning, but it requires a DX-4 roll to catch it, and its constant attempts to return to its owner give anyone else a -4 to fight with it.
A loyal weapon can be sold or given away at any time, but the transaction must be wholly voluntary; it is then loyal to the new owner. It may have only one owner at a time. Limiting spells may be used to limit the class of people who can use it.
Note that if this spell is placed on a Dancing Weapon (below) it makes the Dancing Weapon spell almost worth- less. The effect will be a Loyal weapon that strikes at foes on its way back to its owner (but at no other time).
Energy cost to cast: 750 per pound of the weapon (minimum 1 pound).
Prerequisites:
Apportation.


Quick-Draw
Enchantment
The weapon will leap to the
owner’s hand when he wants it,
becoming ready instantly (no Ready
maneuver required!). Only the owner’s
mental command is required; no die
roll is needed.
The enchantment does not work if
the weapon is more than a yard away,
or if it is tied down, peacebonded (tied
into the scabbard with rope or wire),
within a pack, etc. A weapon with this
spell does not become unready after
attacking or parrying (p. B382).
Energy cost to cast: 300 per pound
of weight (minimum 1 pound); 2,000
for a quiver, bag, etc., from which
ordinary missiles will leap into the
wearer’s hand at need.
Prerequisites:
Enchant
and
Apportation.

Item
May be cast on any sort of tool –
not just a weapon.

Dancing Weapon
Enchantment
A weapon enchanted with this spell
fights on its own at the owner’s command, hanging in the air as though
wielded by an invisible warrior. It has
a skill of 15, a Basic Speed of 5, and a
ST (for damage purposes) equal to its
Power. It uses intelligent strategy and
follows its owner’s spoken or mental
commands about which enemy to
attack. It continues fighting until it is
dealt with (see below) or its owner
dies or tells it to stop. This spell does
not work on a missile weapon!
Any attack on a dancing weapon is
at a penalty: from -4 (for a polearm) to
-5 (a sword or axe) to -6 (a dagger or
pistol). If the weapon gets a critical
miss, or is struck by a critical hit, it is
“stunned” and out of the fight (unless
it breaks, in which case it is
destroyed). If its owner is killed, it falls
to the floor – but if he is merely
knocked unconscious, it continues to
attack the closest foe. A dancing
weapon can also be trapped in a net or
bag (same basic roll as to hit it, but the
GM can give bonuses or penalties
depending on the cleverness of the
method used).
The weapon can also be left with
orders to attack anyone who
approaches within a certain distance;
a Link can be used to activate it only if
a certain event takes place. Once activated, if its owner is not around, it
attacks anyone in range – closest first,
unless the Link had other instructions.
A dancing weapon cannot change
owners while animated; grasping the
handle of a dancing weapon is not
enough to make it change sides.
Energy cost to cast: 1,000 per
pound of the weapon’s weight (minimum 1 pound). Double the cost to get
a weapon with a Basic Speed of 6, or
with skill of 18. Multiply cost by 4 to
get a weapon with both advantages.
Prerequisites:
Enchant
and
Dancing Object.

Defending Weapon
Enchantment
The subject weapon permits its
wielder to parry more skillfully; each
level of enchantment will give the
wielder a +1 to Parry, up to a maximum of +3. The spell does not protect
the weapon from being broken
(p. B401).
If this enchantment is combined
with Dancing Weapon, the weapon
attacks opponents engaged with the
owner and wards off blows from
attackers when possible. It uses the
weapon’s skill as per Dancing Weapon,
plus this spell’s bonus. The owner can
command it to defend a given side of
him (much like Dancing Shield) and
to either defend (in which case it gets
two parries per turn) or attack (in
which case it gets a single attack and a
single parry each turn). If a dancing,
defending weapon does not parry a
blow, the owner may still use any of
his own applicable defenses.
This spell can only be cast on a balanced weapon that can normally
parry.
Energy cost to cast: 500 for +1 to
parry, 1,000 for +2, and 2,000 for +3.
The spell may be recast at a higher
level as per Accuracy.
Prerequisites:
Enchant
and
Dancing Object.

Weapon Spirit (VH)
Enchantment
Transfers the personality and some
of the intelligence of a recently
deceased being (humanoid or not –
dogs are popular subjects) to a
weapon, usually a sword. The
enchantment is at -1 for each full day
that elapsed between the donor’s
death and the beginning of the
enchantment. Most of the body must
be present at the beginning of the
enchantment, but may disposed of
after it commences.
The enchanter can pass on as little
or as much of the donor’s IQ as he
wishes to the weapon, as well as some
of the donor’s skills, advantages, and
disadvantages. The weapon has no
memory of its former existence.
Although it has no sensory organs, it
possesses sight and hearing (Per 10).
Quirks (or disadvantages reduced to
quirk level) are sometimes transferred
from the donor to the weapon,
whether the enchanter wants them or
not (this is why dogs are popular; their
personalities tend to make biddable
but effective weapons).
The weapon can communicate
with its wielder through an extremely
basic empathy. When the wielder
takes a course of action the weapon
approves of, he gets a “good feeling,”
and if he takes one the weapon disapproves of, he gets an equivalent “bad
feeling.” The weapon may be enchanted with the Voices spell to give it a
voice. Various Communication and
Empathy enchantments may be
added to the weapon to enhance the
communication.
Each time it gets a new wielder, the
weapon must make a single reaction
roll, which sets the tone for its relationship with the wielder from that
point on. On a very good reaction, the
weapon will do literally anything for
its wielder; on a very bad one, it refuses to communicate or cooperate in
any way. The GM should record the
result; the weapon cannot be forced to
roll a new reaction by being passed
back and forth between wielders!
Energy cost to cast: 100 per point of IQ transferred, plus 25 times the CP cost of each skill, plus 50 times the total CP cost of all the advantages and disadvantages (minimum of zero). Add 300 for Voices.
Prerequisites: asdjadsdjk

Cornucopia
Enchantment
Gives a quiver, bag of pellets, or
other container of ammunition an
“infinite” supply of one type of ammunition – but items must be taken out
by hand, one at a time. Each missile
exists for one minute after being
removed from the container; then it
vanishes (or, if picked up by anyone
but the Cornucopia’s owner, it vanishes immediately). Therefore, this spell
cannot be used to make a single
quiver supply enough arrows for an
army! It cannot be cast on a weapon.
A high-tech wizard could create a
pouch that always contained one
armor-piercing tracer shell; he could
not enchant a .50-caliber machinegun to fire forever.
Energy cost to cast: This is tricky,
because skillful players will find many
creative ways to pervert this item. GMs
who find Cornucopia a nuisance may
ban it entirely. In general: Energy cost
is equal to 50 times the $ value, in the
current game world, of the missile provided by the Cornucopia quiver. Thus,
a quiver that provided ordinary arrows
($2 each) would cost 100 energy to create.
This means that a mage in a
medieval world could not make a
“quiver” for high-tech ammo; that
ammo is priceless in his world. A
Cornucopia quiver can be made to
produce magic arrows, but only if the
creating mage is capable of making
such an arrow – and the energy cost
will be tremendous.
Prerequisites: Enchant and two
other Weapon Enchantment spells.

Quick-Aim

Ghost Weapon
Enchantment
The subject missile weapon (bow,
sling, etc) gains uncanny responsiveness; in game terms, an Aim action
taken with the subject weapon has the
effect of two turns of aiming.
Energy cost to cast: 100. For 200
energy, one Aim action may count for
three turns of aiming. Halve the cost if
subject is a missile (e.g., a javelin or
throwing axe). The enchantment
doesn’t work on ammunition (like
arrows). Note that this spell may be
recast at a higher level as per Accuracy.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Grace.


Accuracy
Enchantment
Makes a weapon more likely to hit
by adding to the user’s effective skill.
Cost: See table below. Divide cost
by 10 if the subject is a missile (e.g., an
arrow or a bullet).
Bonus Cost
+1:   250
+2:   1000
+3:   5000
Note: If a weapon already has this
spell at a low level, a caster may recast
the spell at a higher level (making the
weapon more accurate). The cost for
the new spell is the difference between
the levels; the “old” spell does not add to
the item’s resistance to the “new” one.
Prerequisites: Enchant and at least
five Air spells.

Puissance
Enchantment
Adds to the basic damage a
weapon does when it hits.
Cost: See table below. Divide cost
by 10 if the subject is a missile (e.g., an
arrow or a bullet). Double cost if the
subject is a missile weapon (e.g., a
bow or a gun).
Damage-Bonus Cost
+1:          250
+2:          1000
+3:          5000
May be recast at a higher level, as
per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisites: Enchant and at least
five Earth spells.
Energy cost to cast: 250 per pound
of weight (minimum 1 pound).
Prerequisites: Enchant and Solidify.

Ghost Weapon
Enchantment
A weapon enchanted with this spell affects ghosts (and other insubstantial beings and spirits) as if they were tan- gible. If the weapon itself is made intangible (through whatever means the GM deems feasible), the weapon still affects the physical world at the whim of its wielder.
Energy cost to cast: 250 per pound of weight (minimum 1 pound).
Prerequisites: Enchant and Solidify.

Spell Arrow
Enchantment
Similar to a Spell Stone, a spell arrow stores a spell until it is fired. The archer need not be a mage. The arrow’s user must concentrate for the appropriate time to cast to “arm” the spell. This cannot be simultaneous with aiming the bow, and isn’t reduced by high skill (but see Speed Skill Arrow, below). An unused spell arrow disarms after 1 minute. The spell acti- vates when the arrow hits a solid object; roll against the effective skill of the arrow’s enchanter. If the roll is suc- cessful, the spell is cast. If it is a nor- mal failure, the spell is simply wasted. Critical failures go to the Critical Spell Failure Table (p. 7). If the arrow is fired without the required concentration, the spell is wasted, but the arrow still does normal damage.
The spell’s energy is included in the enchantment. The archer need not (and cannot) provide any to cast the spell or maintain it. Similarly, the archer may not cancel the spell once cast, though the enchanter may speci- fy a shorter duration than normal, and may also invest extra energy so the spell will maintain itself.
The head of a spell arrow must contain a jewel worth $10¥P2 + $40¥P, where P is the maximum energy of the contained spell. The gem is destroyed when the spell activates. (The rest of the arrow may be recoverable, but is now nonmagical.)
Any spell that can be enchanted into a magic item can be placed in a spell arrow, except for Blocking spells, Enchantment spells, Melee spells, or spells whose magic item description specifies “must touch.” Note that some permissible spells are pointless (e.g., Beast-Soother), since the archer must hit the target with an arrow any- way. Enchantments may be placed on the arrow itself normally, including limiting enchantments.
The only decision the archer can make is what he’s aiming at. If the spell requires a subject, whatever the arrow hits is the subject. (If it is not a legal subject – e.g., a wooden wall for Strike Blind – the spell is wasted.) What constitutes a “solid object” may require the GM’s judgment (for exam- ple, drops of rain are not enough to trigger the spell). If it is an Area spell, the point of impact is the center of the area. If it is a Missile spell, the effect is as if the missile hit the target, in addi- tion to the arrow (the missile does not launch itself from the point of impact). If the spell creates an object, the object appears as close as possible to the point of impact. If the spell would normally affect both a subject and the caster (e.g., (Animal) Control) the archer is treated as the caster. If the spell requires a human target, the spell still works even if the arrow hits clothing instead of skin. The enchanter specifies everything else: duration, area, precise effect, etc.
Analyze Magic can reveal what spell a spell arrow contains, how much energy was invested, and so on (one question per casting). Arrows intended for the consumer market are usually color-coded.
Energy cost to cast: 30 times the contained spell’s casting cost, includ- ing maintenance cost if desired, so long as the item is an arrow or cross- bow bolt.
EnchantmentMay be recast at a higher level, as per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisites: Enchant and at least five Earth spells.
The GM may decide this spell can work on other kinds of missiles (e.g., bullets). If so, for those missiles, mul- tiply the contained spell’s casting cost by 1/10 the missile’s Max range, instead of 30. If the missile should pass beyond the Max range (for exam- ple, if fired from a more powerful gun) the spell is wasted. (This last rules does not apply to actual arrows and bolts.) Note that the need for a jewel still applies to bullets!
Prerequisite: Spell Stone.


Blank Spell Arrow (VH)
Enchantment
This enchantment creates a spell
arrow with no spell stored. Instead,
any spellcaster may, at a later date,
place a spell in the blank spell arrow,
and then use it as if it were a normal
spell arrow.

Blank spell arrows have a capacity,
representing the energy cost of the
largest spell they can hold. When a
spellcaster wishes to use the arrow, he
casts the spell normally, but directs it
into the arrow. If the spell is too big for
the arrow, it is wasted. After the arrow
has been filled, it must be used within
one day (by the spellcaster or someone
else), or the spell dissipates harmlessly,
making the arrow blank again.
All other rules for spell arrows also
apply to blank spell arrows, with one
exception. If the caster of the spell is
also the archer, he can determine its
effect at firing time, and maintain it
normally. (He cannot put more or less
casting energy into the spell at firing;
casting energy must be in the arrow.)
Energy cost to cast: 30 times the
desired capacity. The Spell Arrow
rules for non-arrow missiles apply to
Blank Spell Arrow as well.
Prerequisite: Spell Arrow.

Speed Spell Arrow
Enchantment
This spell can only be cast on
missiles enchanted with Spell Arrow.
Like the Speed enchantment, it
reduces the time the archer must concentrate to activate the contained
spell. Each level of Speed Spell Arrow
halves the concentration time. If time
is reduced below 1 second, no
concentration is required.
Cost: See table below.
Speed  Cost
1      50
2      100
3      200
Double the cost for each additional
point. May be recast at a higher level,
as per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisites: Speed, Spell Arrow.

Fortify
Enchantment
Increases the DR of clothing or a
suit of armor.
Cost: See table below.
DR Bonus   Cost
+1         50
+2         200
+3         800
+4         3000
+5         8000

The spell can be recast to strengthen it, as per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Deflect
Enchantment
Adds a Defense Bonus to armor,
clothing, a shield, or a weapon. This
adds to all active defense rolls made
by the user.
Cost: See table below.
DB    Cost
+1    100
+2    500
+3    2000
+4    8000
+5    20000
This spell can be recast to
strengthen it, as per Accuracy (p. 65).
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Lighten
Enchantment
Makes armor or shields lighter and
easier to carry. The subject becomes
lighter only when it is actually being
worn. Armor in a backpack would still
have its full weight.
Energy cost to cast: 100 to cut the item’s weight by 25%. 500 to cut its weight in half.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Dancing Shield
Enchantment
A shield enchanted with this spell protects its owner as if wielded by an invisible shield-bearer. The shield has Shield-16, Basic Speed 5, and ST equal to the Power of the enchant- ment (for bashing purposes). It follows its owner’s mental or spoken instructions as to which side to guard. If the owner is knocked out, the shield continues protecting him to the best of its abilities. If the owner dies, the shield falls to the ground.
The shield can Block two different attacks per turn, regardless of its owner’s actions (so the owner could parry any blow that got by the shield, for instance). The shield can be instructed to bash (p. B406), in which case its owner forfeits the shield’s pro- tection until the beginning of his next turn (the shield will travel no more than two yards from the owner to bash).
The shield can be attacked at a penalty of its DB-4. The shield’s defense will be either a Block (using Shield/2) or a Dodge (using Speed); it does not get any DB bonus from itself. The shield could also be netted or bagged (standard to-hit roll). If the shield gets a critical miss or is struck by a critical hit, it is stunned and out of the fight until its owner grasps it and “wakes it up” (a Ready maneu- ver). The shield loses its magic if destroyed; if penetrated by an impal- ing or piercing weapon, it loses one point each of Power, Shield skill, and Basic Speed. As always, if Power drops below 15, the item ceases to function.
Energy cost to cast: 250 per pound of the shield’s weight (minimum 1 pound). Double the cost to enchant a shield with Speed 6 or Skill 18. Quadruple the cost to get both. This spell may be recast at a higher level as with Accuracy (p. 65), either to improve or repair the Shield.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Dancing Object.


Defending Shield
Enchantment
The enchanted shield allows its
wielder to block more skillfully; each
level of enchantment gives the wielder
a +1 to Block, up to a maximum of +3.
The spell may not be combined with
Dancing Shield.
Energy cost to cast: 500 for +1 to
Block, 1,000 for +2, and 2,000 for +3.
Cost: See table below.
Block Bonus    Cost
+1             500
+2             1000
+3             2000
The spell may be recast at a higher
level as with Accuracy (p. 65).
Energy cost to cast: 100 to cut the
item’s weight by 25%. 500 to cut its
weight in half.
Prerequisites: Enchant and Grace.

Limit
Enchantment
The enchanted item works only for
the user, or class of users, specified by
the caster when the Limit is cast. This
class of users may be as simple or
complex as the caster wishes. A Limit
spell may affect all the spells on the
item, or just some of them.
Energy cost to cast: 200.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Name
Enchantment
Gives a magical name to an
enchanted object. The magic of the
subject functions only for someone
who knows its name. The user must
speak the item’s name the first time he
tries to use it, to show he knows the
name.
Energy cost to cast: 400, or 200 if
the name is written on the item. It
must be readable (GM’s decision). It
may be small, hidden, or even disguised, but a person examining the
item must be able to see it. This
provision is a major reason for the
popularity of dead and obscure languages among wizards – writing your
item’s name on it in an extinct language is almost as safe as not writing
it at all, and much cheaper.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Password
Enchantment
The reverse of the Name enchantment. A magical item with a Password
functions unless the Password is spoken. If the Password is spoken, the
item will be inert until the next time
its powers would normally be invoked
– or for one minute (choice of person
making the item). An item may have
some spells that are passworded and
others that are not. The details, of
course, depend on the spell.
Examples: (a) a magic ring that
gave the power of flight – but puts the
wearer in Suspended Animation
unless the password was used; (b) a
Pentagram that can be “turned off”
with a word; (c) a Dancing Sword that
stops swinging for one minute if the
password is said.
Energy cost to cast: 400. Halve this
cost if the password is written on the
item (must be readable).
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Link
Enchantment
Same as the “Item” description
under Meta-Spells, pp. 131-132.

Attune

Powerstone
Enchantment
Infuses mana into an object for
later use by a wizard. Traditionally, a
gemstone serves as the subject of this
spell (for this reason, “Powerstone” is
the generic word for an object containing stored mana), but any object
can potentially be used. Any wizard
touching a Powerstone may take any
or all of the energy it contains, using it
instead of his body’s own energy to
cast a spell.
Each Powerstone is said to have a
“capacity.” This is the maximum
amount of energy it can hold. Since a
wizard can only use one Powerstone
at a time, a large Powerstone is more
useful than a handful of small ones. A
large Powerstone can be used to cast a
large spell; a group of small ones can
be used one at a time to help maintain
a spell, but cannot be used all at once.
A Powerstone “recharges” itself
after use, by absorbing mana from the
surrounding area. The rate of
recharge varies with the area’s mana
level.

Local Mana
None
Low
Normal
High
Very High

Recharge Rate
None
1 point/week
1 point/day
1 point/12 hours
1 point/6 hours

A Powerstone does not recharge if
it is within six feet of a larger
Powerstone. Stones of the same size
split the available mana and recharge
at slower speed. This unfortunate fact
means that the owner of several
Powerstones must let some of them
out of his sight to get them recharged!
A Powerstone is enchanted one step
at a time. The first time Powerstone is
cast on an object, it becomes an
uncharged Powerstone with capacity
1. Each additional casting increases its
capacity by 1. Thus, 15 castings would
create a Powerstone with a capacity of
15. But note that with this many castings, there would be a cumulative
chance of nearly 1 in 4 that a critical
failure would be rolled at some point,
destroying the stone. For 60 successive
castings, the cumulative chance of
critical failure is 2 in 3!
Further, each ordinary failure
while casting puts some sort of magical “quirk” on the stone. Thus, it is
possible for work for months and end
up with a 20-energy Powerstone that
smells like fish and can only be used
on Wednesdays . . . This makes big
stones without serious flaws more
valuable than others of the same
strength. The quirks of a Powerstone
are set by the GM, and can be used as
a tool for campaign balance. Most of
them will be peculiar, arbitrary limitations on how the stone can recharge
(e.g., only while bathed in bat blood)
or how it can be used (e.g., only on
Fire spells; only by a green-eyed virgin; not by anyone wearing a hat). A
severe quirk affects the user of the
stone (e.g., renders him mute for an
hour).
The caster knows if his spell has
failed, but not what quirk his
Powerstone now has. The Analyze
Magic spell can determine what
quirks a Powerstone has. Two failures
in a row indicate that no further
growth is possible for that stone.
Any object may be used to produce
a Powerstone. However, it is easier to
enchant a Powerstone using an item
with intrinsic value. The cost to cast
Powerstone is quadrupled if the item
being enchanted has a value of less
than $10*P + $40*P, where P is the
target capacity of the Powerstone.
This is one reason gemstones are popular; a valuable stone is compact and
durable.

A Powerstone is uncharged when
created (though if it already contained
energy, that energy is unaffected by a
casting to increase its capacity). The
energy from a Powerstone cannot be
used for further enchantments on that
stone – a Powerstone cannot be used
to help enchant itself!
Energy cost for each casting: 20.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

“Dedicated” Powerstones
If a Powerstone is attached to an
item before that item is enchanted, the
Powerstone becomes a part of the
magical item. It is then a “dedicated”
Powerstone. The item’s user may tap
its energy – but only to power the
spells cast by or through that item.
If a dedicated Powerstone is
removed from a magical item, the
magical item is automatically broken
and loses its enchantment, but the
Powerstone is intact, and becomes a
“normal” Powerstone again. (Of
course, if the Powerstone is built into
the item in some way – e.g., set in a
magic ring – a successful skill roll may
be required to remove it without
breaking it.)
The advantage of a dedicated
Powerstone is that its energy, being
specifically channeled, is used twice
as efficiently. A one-point dedicated
Powerstone gives two points of energy

(but still recharges in one day in a
normal-mana area).

“Exclusive” Powerstones
An item can also be made with a
built-in Powerstone, in such a way that
only its integral Powerstone(s) can
power it. This is done exactly as for
dedicated Powerstones, but the energy
of an exclusive Powerstone is three
times as efficient – i.e., a one-point
exclusive Powerstone delivers three
points of energy, but then the item is
useless until the stone recharges.

item may be re-enchanted with multiple applications of the spell. If a
Manastone “quirks” in enchanting, the
quirks (naturally) must be appropriate
to a nonrecharging object (no quirks
about recharging limitations!).
Manastones have no effect on the
recharge rate of nearby Powerstones.
Energy cost to cast: 5. Each casting
charges the stone with a single point
of energy.
Prerequisite: Enchant.

Staff
Enchantment
Enchants a magic staff – see Magic Staffs (p. 13) for details. Though many magic items must be in the form of a wand or staff, they do not have to have this spell on them. Many mages use various Limiting enchantments so that others can’t use their staffs – but this is not automatic.
Energy Cost: 30.
Prerequisite: Enchant.
Any rod-shaped piece of organic
material (wood, bone, ivory, etc.) up to
6 feet long. May be decorated with
other materials, like gems and precious metals. A small staff is often
called a “rod,” and a very short and
slender one, a “wand.”

Homunculus
Enchantment
Grow a miniature image from your
flesh. This image, called a homunculus,
has ST 1, DX 0, and no IQ or HT. It
must be kept inside a glass bottle and
fed at least 1 HP worth of human blood
each day to remain alive. If the bottle is
broken or submitted to intense heat or
light, the homunculus dies.
Whenever he wishes, the caster can
move his spirit into the homunculus,
no matter how far away it is (as per
Possession, p. 49), at an energy cost of
4 for the first minute and 2 for every
minute thereafter. He may then
observe and communicate with anyone in the homunculus’ presence.
Although the caster can cast spells
from the homunculus (using his own
energy), he cannot perform any physical action, since the homunculus is
trapped inside the bottle. The caster
may return to his original body at will.
If a hostile wizard gains possession
of a live homunculus, he can cast
Communication and Empathy spells
at the homunculus’ creator at no
range penalty! The creator also resists
any such spells at -5 when cast
through the homunculus. A homunculus is thus a great vulnerability and is
only entrusted to the most faithful of
servants.
The caster may own several
homunculi; he can move his spirit to
only one at a time. While thus “away,”
the caster’s body is very vulnerable
and should be safeguarded.
Energy cost to cast: 800.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and MindSending.

Effigy (VH)
Enchantment
A mage can enchant an effigy, a lifesize statue of himself, which attracts
hostile magic directed at him to itself.
Like Malefice, Effigy is a lasting spell,
which continues until its Endurance is
reduced to zero. Every time a spell
attacks the effigy’s maker, the effigy
resists with its current Endurance,
modified for the distance separating it
from him (use the long-distance modifiers, p. 14). If the effigy succeeds, the
spell affects it rather than its maker,
The GM must decide what constitutes a “hostile” spell; for instance,
Deathtouch is, but Mind-Reading
isn’t. Redirected spells that have no
effect on inanimate statues (such as
Paralyze Limb or Death Vision)
instead “attack” the enchantment. The
effigy then resists with its current
Endurance. Every such successful
attack reduces the effigy’s Endurance
by one; when the effigy’s Endurance
drops below 0, it ceases functioning. A
critical failure by the effigy or a critical success by the attacking spell also
breaks the enchantment, as does physical destruction. An enchanter may
only have one effigy at any one time.
Energy cost to cast: 1,000.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Enchant,
Scryguard, and Ward.

Soul Stone (VH)
Enchantment
By transferring his life force to a
Soul Stone, a sorcerer becomes
immortal. Although his body may still
be hurt (burned, cut, crushed . . .), he
may not be killed as long as the soul
stone is safe. The caster becomes
immune to disease, poison, and aging.
He automatically makes all HT “death
checks” caused by injury. He may still
fall unconscious.
If the soul stone is destroyed, the
caster dies, so it is usually hidden in a
very hard-to-reach place. Death may
also come from some magical causes,
such as a Planar Visit failure. Note
that the stone need not literally be a
piece of rock; examples from folklore
and fiction include the caster’s own
heart (removed once the spell is cast,
presumably!), eggs, and more.
Soul Stone and Soul Jar are
mutually exclusive.
Cost: 500. One try; if the enchantment fails, the caster dies!
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Enchant,
and Soul Jar.

Crystal Ball
Enchantment
Used in the Crystal-Gazing variant
of Divination. Requires a ball of flawless crystal at least 2” in diameter
(value $1,000). A 3” ball (value $5,000)
gives +1 to divinations. A 4” ball (value
$20,000) gives +2.
Energy cost to create: 1,000.
Prerequisite: Divination (CrystalGazing).

Lich (VH)
Enchantment
As listed under Necromantic Spells,
p. 159.

Wraith (VH)
Enchantment
As listed under Necromantic Spells,
p. 160.

Ignite Fire
Regular
Produces a single spot of heat, and is
used to set fire to a readily flammable
object. It works best on paper and cloth,
and will not affect any item that would
not burn in an ordinary fire. In particular, it will not set fire to a living being!
Once ignited, the fire burns normally.
Duration: One second.
Cost: Depends on the amount of
heat desired:
1 – As though a match had been
held to the subject. Lights a candle,
pipe, or tinder in one second.
2 – As though a torch had been
held to the subject. Ignites paper or
loose cloth in one second, ordinary
clothes being worn in four seconds.

3 – As though a blowtorch had
been held to the subject. Ignites dry
firewood or clothes being worn in one
second, leather in two seconds, and
heavy wood in six seconds.
4 – As though burning magnesium
or phosphorus had been held to the
subject. Ignites coal in one second,
heavy wood in two seconds.
Cost to maintain is the same as the
original cost to cast.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 100; item must include a
small ruby worth $50.

Seek Fire
Information
Tells the caster the direction and
approximate distance of the nearest
significant fire or source of intense
heat. Use the long-distance modifiers
(p. 14). Any known fires or sources of
heat may be excluded if the caster
specifically mentions them before
beginning. The caster may also specify that he is seeking a specific type of
fire, based on the fire’s fuel (natural
gas flame, alcohol fire, wood fire, etc.).
Cost: 1.

Item
A forked stick. Cost to create: 50
energy and a small ruby worth $100.

Create Fire
Area
Fills the area of effect with fire that
requires no fuel (if cast in midair, it
produces a sphere of flame, which
falls to the ground). This is real fire,
and will eventually ignite any flammable objects it touches. Cannot be cast
within rock, foes, etc.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2. Half that to maintain.
Ordinary fires set by this spell do not
require maintenance.


Prerequisite: Ignite Fire or Seek
Fire.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 300; item must include a
ruby worth $200.

Extinguish Fire
Area
Puts out all ordinary and magical
fires in its area of effect. Has no effect
on materials that are intrinsically
superheated – molten steel, lava,
plasma, etc.
Duration: Once out, a fire stays out.
Base cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Ignite Fire.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 400; item must include a
ruby worth $300 and a black onyx
worth $100.

Shape Fire
Area
Control the shape of any flame.
Each shape change requires a second of
concentration. Once shaped, the flame
keeps that shape until the spell expires,
without concentration. Moving a flame
requires constant concentration (the
flame moves at Move 5, on the caster’s
turn). A natural fire cannot move to a
place that it can’t burn, but flame made

with the Create Fire spell needs no fuel
and can move almost anywhere.
Flame shaped with this spell normally retains its volume. If the fire is
“spread out” across twice its original
area, it only does half damage; if
spread across three times its original
area, it does 1/3 damage; and so on.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2. Half that to maintain.
Prerequisite: Ignite Fire.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 400; item must include a
ruby worth $300.

Phantom Flame
Area
Creates an area of imaginary flame.
Those nearby feel heat (and pain, if they
touch it); items inside appear to burn.
However, the flame does not spread,
and does no real damage. Even the pain
it creates subsides to a tingling after the
first shock. Shape Fire and Extinguish
Fire both affect this phantom flame;
water will not affect it.
This is also an Illusion and
Creation spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Fire or Simple
Illusion.

and resists all heat less than star-heat.
Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisite: Extinguish Fire.

Item
An area may be permanently
Fireproofed; multiply the base cost by
100. A small quantity of powdered
ruby must be used (about $10 per
energy point’s worth).


Fireproof
Area
Prevents ignition of fires within the
affected area: matches won’t light, flint
won’t make sparks, and so on. Does
not extinguish a fire brought in from
outside the spell’s area, although such
a fire would fail to ignite anything else.
Useful anywhere that fire is a hazard
(as in a gunpowder factory, for example). Any magical attempt to light a fire
is at -5 to skill. This spell doesn’t resist
really intense heat (as from lava or battle lasers), but it does stop guns from
working!
Duration: 1 day.
Base cost: 3. Doubled cost gives a
-10 to magical attempts to light fires, and resists all heat less than star-heat. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisite: Extinguish Fire.

Flame Jet
Regular
Shoot a jet of flame from one fist. Each turn, the caster rolls versus DX- 4 or Innate Attack skill to hit, and rolls for damage if he hits. This attack may be dodged or blocked, but not parried. Treat it as a hand weapon – a flaming sword without the sword – but it can- not parry! This is a wonderfully flashy spell, good for magic shows, melee combat, burning through ropes, etc. The caster may cast the spell as many times as he has hands and have a Flame Jet in each hand; a Flame Jet held in the caster’s “off” hand suffers the usual -4 penalty to hit.
For cinematic mage-dueling action, the GM may allow a Flame Jet to parry another Flame Jet. This allows fire wizards to duel mano a mano, which some groups may prefer to the casting and dodging of a more typical duel of magic.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3 points. Does 1d damage for each point put into the spell. The jet’s range in yards is equal to the number of dice. Same cost to main- tain.
Prerequisites: Create Fire and Shape Fire.

Slow Fire
Area
Causes flames to cool down, con- suming their surroundings (and burn- ing people) at a slower rate. The dam- age that the flames do is reduced pro- portionately. This spell acts as a Slow spell on fire elementals and beings with the Body of Fire meta-trait (p. B262). Slow Fire resists Fast Fire.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 for a fire that burns at half the usual rate, 3 for a fire that burns at 1/3 the usual rate, and so on. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Extinguish Fire.

Fast Fire
Makes flames hotter, consuming their surroundings (and burning peo- ple) at a faster rate. The damage that the flames do is proportionately increased. This spell acts as a Great Haste spell on fire elementals and beings with the Body of Fire meta-trait.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 for a double-rate fire, 3 for a triple-rate fire, and so on. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite:

Item

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 375 energy and a $500 ruby.

Deflect Energy
Blocking
Deflects one energy attack about to
hit the subject – including a beam
weapon attack or a Fireball or Lightning spell. Counts as a parry for combat purposes. If the caster is not the subject, apply distance modifiers as for a Regular spell. Deflected attacks may still hit a target beyond the subject.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Shape Fire.


Smoke
Area
Creates an area of dense smoke.
Even one yard’s thickness of such
smoke will block vision. Until it dissipates, it has the effect of tear gas (anyone failing a HT roll is unable to do
anything but cough and weep). The
smoke is somewhat hot and rises
slowly (about one foot per second).
The rate of dissipation depends on the
area and the presence of wind;
indoors, it usually lasts until the spell
expires, but outdoors on a windy day
it may last only 10 seconds or so.
Duration: 5 minutes, except in
windy areas.
Base cost: 1. Half that to maintain.
Prerequisites: Shape Fire and
Extinguish Fire.

Heat
Regular
Raises the temperature of an object. It does not necessarily produce fire, though most things will burn if heated enough. Heat will be radiated away normally. (Use this as a guideline for playable effects – don’t try to turn the spell into a physics exercise!)
Any wizard planning to make extensive use of this spell should arm himself with a list of the melting points of various materials. The spell can have drawbacks. If you were in jail, you might melt your way through the bars . . . but the radiated heat would probably broil you first.
Duration: 1 minute. Each minute raises the target’s temperature by 20°. Maximum temperature possible with this spell is 2,800°.
Cost: 1 for an object up to the size of a fist, 2 for an object up to one cubic yard, and 2 per cubic yard for a larger object. Temperature change can be doubled to 40° per minute for double cost, tripled to 60° per minute for triple cost, and so on. Slower heating costs no less. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Create Fire and Shape Fire.

Cold
Regular
The reverse of Heat (above). It can reduce the temperature of any object to absolute zero, if maintained for long enough.
Duration, Cost, and Time to cast:
Exactly as for Heat, except that each minute lowers the target’s temperature by 20°.
Prerequisite: Heat.

Rain of Fire
Area
Fiery droplets rain from the sky onto the area of effect, causing 1d-1 fire damage per second to all within it. Creatures under the Rain of Fire take damage on their own turns; if less than an entire second is spent in the affected area, damage is halved (round down).
The spell can only be cast out- doors. Armor protects in the usual fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or bet- ter can be held overhead to block the flames, but it may take damage (p. B484). This requires two hands and a Ready action, and succeeds automatically in protecting the char- acter once the shield is readied upwards, but this unreadies the shield from its normal protective functions!
Inanimate objects such as build- ings protect with their DR, but some structures (see HP and DR of Structures, p. B558) may be damaged or catch fire.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1 to cast (minimum 2). Same cost to maintain. For double base cost, the Rain of Fire does 2d-2 per second!
Time to cast: One minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Create Fire.

Resist Cold
Regular
The subject (person, creature, or
object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of cold
and frostbite (but not falling ice,
magical ice spears, etc.).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain. Cost
doubles if subject must resist cold of
-40° or more; cost triples if subject
must resist the cold of absolute zero.
Prerequisite: Heat.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry; only affects
the wearer. Cost to create: 800 energy, a
$500 emerald and a $200 black onyx.

Warmth
Regular
The subject remains comfortably
warm in cold weather, avoiding the
risk of frostbite or hypothermia. This
effectively increases the subject’s “local
temperature” by 30˚F towards his optimum comfort level (p. B93). The spell
offers no protection against magical
cold attacks such as Frostbite. This is
also a Protection and Warning spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Heat.


Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 400; item must include a
ruby worth $300.

Cold
Regular
The reverse of Heat (above). It can
reduce the temperature of any object
to absolute zero, if maintained for
long enough.

Resist Fire
Regular
The subject (person, creature, or object) and anything he carries become immune to the effects of heat and fire (but not electricity).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain. Cost doubles if subject must resist a blast furnace or volcano; cost triples if
subject must resist the heat of a star, nuclear bomb, etc. Only the first level of protection is necessary against combat-type Fire spells.
Prerequisite: Fireproof.

Fireball
Missile
Throw a ball of fire from one hand.
This has 1/2D 25, Max 50, Acc 1. When
it strikes something, it vanishes in a
puff of flame. This spell is likely to
ignite flammable targets.
Cost: Any amount up to your
Magery level per second, for three seconds. The fireball does 1d burning
damage per energy point.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Create
Fire, and Shape Fire.

Item
Staff or wand – the bolt is fired
from the end of the item. Energy cost
to create: 800; must include a ruby
worth $400. Usable only by mages.

Explosive Fireball
Missile
Creates a fireball that affects both
its target and things nearby. This has
1/2D 25, Max 50, Acc 1. Can be thrown
at a wall, floor, etc. (at +4 to hit) to
catch foes in the blast. The target and
anyone closer to the target than one
yard takes full damage. Those further
away divide damage by three times
their distance in yards (round down).
Cost: Any amount up to twice your
Magery level per second, for three seconds. The fireball does 1d burning
damage per full 2 points of energy.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Fireball.

Item
Staff or wand – the bolt is fired
from the end of the item. Energy cost
to create: 1,200; must include a ruby
worth $500. Usable only by mages.

Essential Flame
Area
As for Create Fire, except that the
fire created is the magical essence of
fire. Any mage can tell the difference
by looking. It cannot be extinguished
by ordinary water or ordinary magic,
but only by a similar quantity of
Essential Water or by a Dispel Magic
spell. Essential Flame does +1 damage to anyone it burns (+2 to watery
creatures).
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 3. 2 to maintain. This
flame ignites all flammable materials,
and the entire blaze remains Essential
as long as the spell is maintained. If
the spell is not maintained, any
materials that were ignited continue
to burn with ordinary flame.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: At least six other Fire
spells.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 800;
must include a $400 ruby.

Flaming Weapon
Regular
Causes any weapon to burst into
flame, which does not harm the user
but lets the weapon do +2 damage to
foes or flammable objects (after penetrating armor and figuring other
bonuses). Metal weapons are not damaged; wooden ones turn to ashes as
soon as the spell ends. The weapon
also gives off light as a torch.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Heat.

Item
A weapon that flames whenever
used, at no energy cost to the user.
Energy cost to create: 750; a $400 ruby
must be set in the weapon.

Flaming Missiles
Regular
Like Flaming Weapon, but cast on a
missile weapon. The weapon itself
acquires a shimmering, fiery appearance. Any missile it fires bursts into
flame, doing +2 damage as per
Flaming Weapon; it burns to ashes
after it hits a target or after 10 seconds,
whichever comes first.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Cost
doubles if the missiles to be fired are
stone or metal.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Flaming Weapon.

Item
A missile weapon that fires flaming
missiles whenever used, at no energy
cost to the user. Energy cost to create:
1,000; a $500 ruby must be set in the
weapon.


Flaming Armor
Regular
The subject is sheathed in flames
without feeling any discomfort – he,
and anything he carries, is under a
basic Resist Fire spell. The flames provide the usual illumination and heat to
their surroundings. The subject’s
melee attacks do an extra point of fire
damage.
Any melee attack that hits the subject triggers a 1d Flame Jet backlash
along the weapon at the foe. This
attack automatically hits the hand
holding the weapon if the weapon’s
Reach was 1 or less. Should the subject grapple or be grappled, the foe
takes 3d burning damage, but the spell
will be broken.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Resist Fire,
and Flame Jet.

Item
(a) Staff or jewelry. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 600; must
include $300 worth of rubies. (b) Cape
or armor. Only affects the wearer.
When activated, the cape seems literally woven of flames; it will protect
against attacks from the back and
sides, but not from the front, unless it
is wielded as a light cloak (see Cloak,
p. B184). Energy cost to create: 700 for
the cape, 1,000 for armor.

Fire Cloud
Area
Creates a swirling cloud of flames
and fiery embers. It does not block
vision, but inflicts burning damage to
all within it. Creatures in the cloud
take damage on their own turns. If less
than an entire second is spent in the
affected area, damage is halved (round
down). Armor protects normally. Only
highly flammable materials may catch
fire.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Base cost: 1 to 5; the cloud inflicts 1
point of damage per second for every
energy point put into the base cost.
Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 to 5 seconds,
depending on base cost.
Prerequisites: Shape Air and
Fireball.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Cost to create: 175 energy
and a $500 ruby.

Breathe Fire (VH)
Regular
Similar to Flame Jet, except that
the flame issues from the caster’s
mouth, Breathe Fire cannot be maintained, and each energy point buys
1d+1 damage instead of 1d. Caster
rolls to hit against DX-2 or Innate
Attack skill. This counts as an action;
the caster must be facing the target.
No hand gestures are required to cast
this spell; certain lip and tongue
motions are made instead. Thus,
Breathe Fire can be cast “no hands” at
any level of skill.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Flame Jet,
and Resist Fire.

Item
Jewelry. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 1,000; must
include $500 worth of gold and a $500
ruby.

Burning Death (VH)


Burning Touch
Melee
Wreathes the caster’s hand in
flames. The first target struck after the
spell is cast suffers 1d of fire damage
for every point of energy that the caster puts into the spell. Armor does not
protect, but natural DR does.
Cost: 1 to 3.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
six Fire spells including Heat.

Body of Flames (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
Subject gains the Body of Fire meta-trait (p. B262) for the duration of the spell. Clothes (up to 6 pounds) also become fire, but lose any magic powers they might have had. He can carry nothing while in this form.
Duration: 1 minute. The spell expires if the subject loses conscious- ness.
Cost: 12 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Breathe Fire.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Cost to create: 700 energy and
a $500 ruby.

Burning Death (VH)
Melee; Resisted by HT
Causes the victim to burn from within. The caster must strike the sub- ject to trigger this spell; hit location is irrelevant. Every turn, the victim must roll against HT; on a failure (critical or not), he takes 1d-1 fire damage. On a success, he takes no damage that turn; on a critical success, the spell is broken. Neither DR nor Resist Fire
protects against this injury! For the duration of the spell, the victim expe- riences almost unbearable discomfort, equivalent to the effects of a Sickness spell (p. 138).
If the spell is maintained long enough, the victim’s skin and clothes start to char and little flames dart out here and there. Once the victim dies, his body bursts into flame and burns until only a little pile of ashes remains.
Undead beings are not affected. The caster must concentrate while maintaining this spell, but need not remain in physical contact.
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Heat, and Sickness.


Seek Food
Information
Determines the direction, distance, and general nature of the nearest sig- nificant source of food. Use the long- distance modifiers (p. 14). The food found will be wholesome, but not nec- essarily appetizing – e.g., edible insects. Any known sources of food (such as those delicious insects) may be excluded if the caster specifically mentions them before beginning.
Cost: 2.

Item

Test Food
Information
dentifies whether a substance is good to eat. The spell tells nothing about taste or nutrition; it detects poi- sons, dangerous decay, or foreign objects (razor blades in fruit). It does not check for magic on food.
Cost: 1 to test a single meal or a sin- gle bottle of wine; 3 to check all the food and drink within a 1-yard radius.

Item

Decay
Regular
Makes food rot away immediately and become worthless (it can be saved if a Counterspell is cast, or Purify Food is cast, within a minute).
Cost: 1 per meal destroyed.
Prerequisite: Test Food.

Season
Regular
Spices and seasons a single container of food to the caster’s prefer- ence. The caster’s cooking skill determines whether the food tastes any bet- ter for it – the spell simply adds the flavors that the caster demands.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2 per meal.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Test Food.


Far-Tasting
Regular
The subject can taste and smell any
object that he can see (even at a great
distance) or taste/smell through solid
objects totaling no more than two
yards of thickness. He automatically
makes all Taste/Smell rolls, though
any substance that would ordinarily
be impossible to taste or smell (an
odorless, tasteless gas such as carbon
monoxide, for example) will remain
undetected. This can be especially useful for sniffing out poisons, since the
effects of a poison do not transfer via
their odors.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and either
Seek Food or Seek Air; cannot have
No Sense of Taste/Smell disadvantage.

Item
Clothing or jewelry; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 200.


Mature
Regular
Causes any foodstuff that must age
and mature as part of its production to
do so more quickly. This is most often
used with beer and wine, but it can
also be used to accelerate cheese,
yogurt, bread dough, or even meat.
Aging processes that normally take
days or weeks (beer, wine, aged
cheese, pickles, dry-aged meats) take
only an hour with this spell. Processes
that normally take hours (bread
dough, yogurt, fresh cheese) take only
a minute. Processes which take years
(vintage wines, thousand-year eggs)
accelerate a year for every casting of
the spell . . . this is a wonderful way to
discover whether a particular vintage
will age well.
Duration: The process takes an
hour (or a minute, as above), but the
food remains mature permanently.
Cost: 1 per pound of food. Cannot
be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Decay or Season.

Item
A small keg that works at no energy cost to the user, but only works a
limited number of times per day.
Energy cost to create: 50 per gallon of
size, per each time/day the item is
usable. For example, a 10-gallon keg
that works twice per day costs
50¥10¥2=1,000 energy to create.

Purify Food
Regular
Removes foreign objects, poisons,
and decay, and renders food fit to eat.
Works only on an edible or formerly
edible item – and if the whole item is
unwholesome, the spell removes all the
unwholesomeness and leave nothing.
Cost: 1 per pound of material to be
purified.
Prerequisite: Decay.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. The item
must touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 400.

Cook
Regular
Turns raw ingredients into a
finished meal. Produces only simple
fare (stews, etc.), which is only as
wholesome as the ingredients. No
cooking-fire is necessary; the spell
provides the heat.

At the GM’s discretion, this spell
may be usable to analyze chemicals or
drugs.
This is also a Knowledge spell.

Cost: 1 per meal.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Test Food and Create
Fire.

Item
A pot that cooks any food placed
within it, at no energy cost to the user.
Requires about a minute to cook. The
size of the pot does not matter, but
each pot can be used only a limited
number of times daily. Energy cost to
create: 30 per meal per day (e.g., a pot
which would cook three meals per
day would
have an
energy
cost of 90
to create).

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 450.

Prepare Game
Regular
“Dresses out” a slain animal. If cast
on a deer, for instance, the hide is
removed, along with all extraneous
body parts and innards. If cast on a
fish, it is gutted and scaled. Nothing is
destroyed by the spell; all of the parts
are simply appropriately separated
and cleaned in such a way as to best
prepare the animal for cooking.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Purify Food.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, jewelry, or knife.
Energy cost to create: 300. (b) Skinning
knife, scaling knife, vegetable peeler,
etc. Usable only on the appropriate
food type. Energy cost to create: 150.

Know Recipe
Information; Special Resistance
When cast on an item of food, this spell places complete knowledge of the components of the food (and the method of preparation used by the
cook) into the mind of the caster. This spell may even be used on alchemical creations. However, such elixirs resist this spell with the skill of
the alchemist that made them.
At the GM’s discretion, this spell may be usable to analyze chemicals or drugs.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: The memory remains crystal clear in the mind of the caster for 1 day. After that, it fades per the Memorize spell (p. 105). Altered recipes may lead to anything from embarrassment (replacing sugar with salt in a dessert) to serious trouble (replacing sugar with salt in a dessert for the King).
Cost: 3. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 15 seconds.
Prerequisites: Far-Tasting and Season.

Item
Staff or wand. The item must
touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 600.

Poison Food
Regular
Introduces a physical poison into food. This poison remains indefinitely, but can be detected by Test Food. Anyone eating the poisoned food must make a HT roll. On a successful roll, they merely feel sick and lose 2 HP. On a failed roll, they will be seized by painful stomach cramps and lose 1d+1 HP immediately; they will be at -3 for all skills or spells until the lost HP is restored.
Cost: 3 per meal.
Prerequisite: Purify Food.


Hunger
Regular; Resisted by HT

Preserve Food
Regular
Keeps any organic material from
spoiling, drying out, etc. Very useful
for travelers!
Duration: 1 week.
Cost: 2 per pound of food. 1 per
pound to maintain.
Prerequisite: Decay.

Create Food
Regular
Produces edible food. This spell is easier when used to convert already existing material into food; the closer the starting material is to food, the tastier the end result will be.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2 per meal to change organic material into food; 3 to change inor- ganic material into food; 4 to conjure food from thin air.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Cook and Seek Food.

Essential Food
Regular
Transforms food, or any other material, into unbelievably good, filling, and nutritious food. Essential Food does not spoil, and six meals of it weigh only a pound
Duration: Indefinite.
Cost: 3 per meal if the starting substance is organic material of some kind; 5 per meal if the original substance is totally inedible.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.

Item



Water to Wine
Regular
Turns water or other drinkable liq- uid into a mildly alcoholic beverage. The nature of the resulting drink depends on the starting material. Water or grape juice becomes wine; fruit juices become “coolers.” The quality of the result depends on the caster’s roll and the quality of the starting liquid.
Duration: Permanent.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Cost: 4 per gallon (half cost for beer, double cost for spirits).
Prerequisites: Purify Water and Mature.

Item

Distill
Regular
Concentrates a liquid by removing water from it. This spell is mostly used to make strong alcoholic beverages, but alchemists also employ it for other purposes. Each use of the spell halves the volume of the liquid, doubling its concentration. One casting turns wine into fortified wine, two turns it into brandy, and three leaves a distillate of
almost pure alcohol. Distill does not work on living subjects.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 per original quart of liquid.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Mature and Destroy
Water.

Fool’s Banquet
Regular
Makes any item seem like attractive, tasty food. The underlying nature of the matter does not change, but those who eat it will find it delicious – not necessarily nutritious, but delicious. Can only be cast on things that can be eaten; it would work on mud, but not on stones. A classic complement to the often dull provender created with Create Food.
Duration: 1 day.
Cost: 2 per meal. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Cook, and Foolishness.


(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 200. (b) Chest or sack;
always on; the contents of the chest
are preserved indefinitely. Energy cost
to create: 20 for every pound of food to
be held (round up).

Monk’s Banquet
Regular
Go without food or water for about
a day with no ill effects.
Duration: 24 hours.
Cost: 6. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisites: Fool’s Banquet and
Resist Pain.

Timeport (VH)
Special
This spell is similar to Teleport,
except that it moves the caster to
another time instead of another
place. Subjective “movement” is
instantaneous.
The more “distant” the target time
is, the greater the energy cost and skill
penalty (see Time modifiers, box).
Unlike Teleport, there is no penalty to
timeport to an “unfamiliar” time; the
GM may, however, decree that any
timeport to the future bears an extra
penalty (-2, perhaps).
If this spell takes the caster to the
future, it is the most likely of many
possible futures. If he returns from
that future and acts on the information
gained, there is no guarantee that the
future he visited will actually occur.
Similarly, a caster who returns to
the past, changes something, and then
returns to his starting time might
return to an alternate timeline. The
amount of variation between the caster’s “home” timeline and the new one
will depend on the GMs view of how
“tamper-resistant” the timestream is
in his game world(s).
This spell is dangerous – the penalties for a failed roll are the same as for
Teleport, substituting time for space.
Also as in Teleport, the caster can carry
no more than Heavy encumbrance
(objects and beings). Roll vs. Body
Sense skill upon arrival, modifying the
roll for changes in velocity, facing, and
orientation.
If the caster wishes to travel simultaneously in both time and space, use
the caster’s Teleport or Timeport skill
(whichever is lowest), and combine
the penalties and costs for distance
and time.

Time Modifiers             Cost      Penalty
Within 1 minute            4         0
1 to 10 minutes            6         -1

each further 10x           +2        -1
Cost: see box.
Prerequisites: Teleport. Magery 3

Item
Staff, wand, or timepiece. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
4,000. An item that will take its user to
one, predetermined time costs 2,000
to create; the item’s creator must be
very familiar with that time.



Timeport Other (VH)
Special; Resisted by Will+1
Same as Teleport Other (p. 147),
except that the subject is Timeported
away from (or to) the caster.
Apply the usual penalty for Regular
spells for the distance between caster
and subject; the Timeport penalties
apply for the time span over which the
caster wants to timeport the subject.
One important difference between
Timeport and Timeport Other is that if
the caster fails the spell roll or if the
spell is successfully Resisted, the
subject does not timeport away!
Cost: As Timeport; also uses the Teleport Other weight multipliers.
Prerequisite: Timeport.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 4,000.

Timeslip
Blocking
Avoid an attack by timeporting out
of its way. The caster slips a few seconds ahead into the future, reappearing in his original location – unless
that spot is now obstructed or occupied! A location is not clear if someone
is standing in it. Any lesser obstruction
is ignored by the spell.
The caster must roll his Body
Sense skill to act on the turn he reappears. If his original location remains
obstructed or occupied, the caster
stays in limbo, reappearing as soon as
the spot becomes clear . . . even if it
takes years! Critical failures have been
known to produce similar disastrous
effects.
If the caster had any spells requiring concentration “on” when he cast
Timeslip, they automatically lapse
(unless they had the caster as their
subject). Likewise, any spell whose
maintenance comes due during the
timeslip also lapses (but see Maintain
Spell, p. 128).
Cost: 1 per second of intended displacement. The spell skill roll is at a -1
penalty for every second of intended
displacement beyond the first one.
Prerequisite: Timeport.

Item
Clothing, jewelry, or timepiece.
Energy cost to create: 500.

Timeslip Other
Blocking
As Timeslip, but usable on others.
Cost: 1 per second of intended displacement. The spell skill roll is at a -1
penalty for every second of intended
displacement beyond the first one.
Prerequisite: Timeport.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Rapid Journey (VH)
Special
Similar to Teleport and Timeport,
except that it allows an immediate
return journey. It works only on the
caster. It does not work with Plane
Shift. Anything carried on the caster’s
person, up to Heavy encumbrance,
goes with him on the trip.
If the skill roll fails, the caster goes
nowhere but otherwise suffers the normal penalties for a failed teleport or
timeport (possible damage, disorientation, and stunning). Teleport Shield
gets to resist twice; once when the caster leaves, and once when he returns.
Once the caster arrives at his destination, he must expend FP to remain
there. As soon as he stops maintaining
his presence (this includes failing a
distraction roll), he snaps back to his
starting place or time.
The return trip normally cannot
fail. However, if the caster succeeded
in the spellcasting by a small margin
(3 or less), the caster must make an IQ
roll (at the distance/time penalty),
while maintaining the spell, to return
to his starting point. One roll may be
attempted per minute. If he then stops
maintaining the spell, he remains
stranded where or when he went. He
may also be stranded if he is knocked
out or if he teleports to a no-mana
zone.
This is also a Movement spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: As Teleport or Timeport, plus
one-fourth the trip’s cost to remain,
per minute.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and either
Teleport (for a Rapid Journey in
space) or Timeport (for a Rapid
Journey in time, or in both time and
space).

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 5,000.

Planar Summons
Special
Summons a creature, such as a
demon or a Thing Man Was Not Meant
To Know, from another plane of existence. The GM determines the predisposition and abilities of this being.
Each plane requires a different Planar
Summons spell. Some exceptionally
potent entities might require their own
spells! If the version of Planar
Summons used does not specify an
individual entity, the caster has no control over whom the spell summons.
Planar Summons cannot be used on
the plane for which it is intended.
When the creature appears, the
caster must immediately try to control
it. Treat this as a Quick Contest
between the caster’s Planar Summons
skill and the entity’s Will. The caster is
at +4 if he knows the creature’s “true
name.”
If the caster wins, he can give the
creature a single command, which it
must carry out. On completing this
task – or after one hour in any event –
the entity usually vanishes. However,
some powerful entities can stay for as
long as they wish . . .
If the caster ties or loses, the creature will react badly. An “evil” being
commits violence or vandalism, while
a “good” one is more likely to depart in
a huff and put in a bad word with the
caster’s gods. Wild or chaotic creatures
are liable to engage in theft and mischief. Extremely alien entities might
react in disturbing and unpredictable
ways.
Duration: Until the task is done or
one hour, whichever is less. Usually.
Cost: 1 point per 10 character
points used to build the summoned
entity. Minimum energy cost is 20
(although this will not always summon a 200-point being). The GM
secretly determines the capabilities of
all summoned creatures. Cannot be
maintained.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
one spell from each of 10 different
colleges.

Planar Visit (VH)
Special
The caster leaves his body behind
and wanders freely as a spirit on
another plane of existence. He is totally insubstantial and cannot affect anything or interact with his surroundings in any way (a blessing in disguise, since this also confers total
physical immunity to whatever environment he is traversing). He cannot
even cast spells, although he can
maintain existing ones. He is likewise
immune to magic that does not affect
minds or spirits (which the caster is,
until he returns to his body). The caster is imperceptible to ordinary senses;
only magic (Astral Vision, Sense
Spirit, Sense Observation and similar
spells) will detect his presence.
There is a different spell for travel
to each plane or dimension. Which
spells exist, and the precise details of
the dimensions they lead to, is up to
the GM. The subject’s senses are
altered to correspond to the average
plane dweller’s; on a plane of perpetual gloom he would have Dark Vision,
on the astral plane he would have his
senses augmented as per Astral Vision,
and on a dimension where all life
forms sense only via sound he would
have Scanning Sense (Sonar). Visiting
very strange alternate planes can be
hazardous to the mental health of an
unsuspecting traveler . . .
The most common plane visited in
most worlds is the astral, which coexists with the mundane universe and
allows visitors to observe real-world
places unseen (at least, unseen except
by natives of the astral realm, if there
are any). While traveling astrally, the
caster moves at twice his full unencumbered Speed and may walk
through walls, mountains, creatures
. . . He may also walk down into the
bowels of the earth or up into the higher atmosphere. Astral Block (p. 159),
Pentagram (p. 124) and the “Utter”
spells (p. 170) stop him, while Repel
Spirits (p. 158) will resist his intrusion.
If the spell ends before his spirit
rejoins his body or if his body is harmed
while his spirit is away, he must roll vs.
HT, using the long-distance modifiers
(p. 14), to stay alive! Needless to say, his
body is totally defenseless for the duration of the spell, though a casual medical examination will reveal it to be
(barely) alive.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Some
planes may cost more, carry a skill
penalty, or both.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and either
Projection or Planar Summons.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 1,000. Although
the item stays with the body while the
spirit walks about, it may still be used

to maintain the spell. (b) Weapon.
Usable only by mages. A spiritual analogue of this item accompanies the
spirit of its user! Energy cost to create:
2,000 per pound (minimum of 1
pound).

Plane Shift (VH)
Special
Bodily transports the caster – along
with anything he is carrying (up to
Heavy encumbrance) – to a particular
plane of existence. Each plane
requires its own Plane Shift spell. This
is a one-way trip. To get back, the caster must know Plane Shift for his home
plane or get a wizard in the other
plane to cast Banish (p. 156) on him.
This spell gives the caster no special
immunity to his surroundings. To safely visit a plane where the natural conditions are vacuum, flame, etc., you must
learn the necessary protective spells.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 20. Some planes may cost
more, carry a skill penalty, or both.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Planar Summons for
the same plane.

Item
Any item; can be used to travel to a
single plane only. Energy cost to create:
100 times the casting cost for the
plane.

Item
Clothing or jewelry. Energy cost to
create: 1,000.

Phase Other (VH)
Blocking
As Phase, but usable on others.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Phase.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 2,000.

Phase
Blocking
Avoid an attack by phasing out of this plane of existence for a moment.
The caster actually becomes ethereal just long enough for the attack to pass through him. He neither disappears nor loses track of his surroundings; no Body Sense roll is required.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and either Plane Shift or Ethereal Body.


Beacon
Area
“Softens up” local space-time, making the area of effect easy to teleport,
timeport, or plane-shift to. The energy
cost and skill penalties to travel to a
beacon are halved (round down). A
beacon may also be used to help
teleport a subject from its vicinity toward the caster.
A beacon is not private; any caster magically transporting himself (or someone else) to the area will benefit from the spell (however, permanently enchanted areas may be Limited or Named; see p. 68).
The caster must, at casting, specify which travel spells his beacon assists. There is no extra cost to create a multi-purpose beacon.
This is also a Movement spell.
Duration: 24 hours.
Base cost: 10 to cast. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisite: Teleport, Timeport, or Plane Shift. The enchanter must know Teleport to create a teleport beacon, Timeport to create a timeport beacon and Plane Shift to create a plane-shift beacon.

Trace Teleport
Information; Resisted by subject spell
When cast soon after someone or
something teleports, timeports or
plane-shifts in or out, this spell gives
the caster a vision of the destination of
the teleported subject. The caster also
gets a good idea of the magnitude of
the skill penalty involved to cast the
spell. On a critical success, the actual
destination will be known, but any
success gives the caster enough of a
sense of the destination to follow, if he
does so within a minute of casting
Trace Teleport.
This is also a Movement spell.
Modifiers: The spell operates at a
cumulative -1 for each minute that
elapses between the teleport and the
casting. There is a further -5 penalty if
the caster didn’t witness the teleport.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Teleport, Timeport, or
Plane Shift.

Item
Any. Energy cost to create: 100.

Divert Teleport (VH)
Blocking; Resisted by
subject spell
When cast on the turn someone or
something teleports, timeports, or
plane-shifts out, this spell allows the
caster to dictate where or when the
subject goes.
The caster must know the spell he
is diverting; he uses the lower of his
skill with Divert Teleport and the subject spell. If the caster wants to divert
a Teleport into a plane shift (for example), he must know both spells and
uses the lowest of his three skills.
The resistance is resolved by comparing the margins of success of both
spells – if the mage who is teleporting
makes his roll by 5, then the mage
attempting to divert him must make
his roll by 6 or more to succeed.
The Divert Teleport takes normal
range penalties between the caster of
Divert Teleport and the caster of
Teleport (or Timeport, etc.), and the
standard skill penalty for the destination that the caster wishes to send the
teleporter to.
The cost to cast the spell is equal to
the difference in cost between the teleporter’s intended destination and his
new destination. If a mage attempts to
teleport 40 miles (9 energy), and
another mage forces him to another
location only 10 yards away (3 energy), the diverting mage will have to
pay 6 energy. The same cost would
apply if the destinations were
reversed. The minimum cost to cast is
3, in any case (high skill will reduce
this normally), and the caster pays the
full energy cost whether or not the
spell succeeds.
Example: Suppose Severin knows
Teleport at 16 and attempts to teleport
100 yards away to his waiting carriage
(skill penalty -2, cost 4). Two yards
away stands Elsdon, who knows
Divert Teleport at 18 and Teleport at
20, and who would prefer that Severin
end up just above a lake which happens to be a mile away (skill penalty
-4, cost 7).
First, Severin makes his attempt,
spending 4 energy and rolling a 10.
Since he needed a 14 or less, this is
success by 4.
Elsdon, using a base skill of 18 (the
lowest of his appropriate spells), takes
a -2 for being two yards away from
Severin, and a further -4 for his intended diversion – his effective skill is 12.
He must roll a 7 (succeeding by 5), to
win the contest and divert Severin.
Whether he does so or not, the calculated cost is 3 energy, so Elsdon must
pay the minimum cost of 3.

Cost: As described above; minimum cost 3.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Trace Teleport.

Teleport Shield
Area
As listed under Protection Spells,
p. 170.

Create Door
Regular
When cast at the near side of a
solid obstruction (wall, hedge, cliff,
etc.), this spell creates a short-term,
short-range gate leading to the other
side. The intervening distance is not
actually traversed by the door’s users –
they are simultaneously teleported
from the near side to the far one.
This spell has the advantage over
Teleport of allowing access to places
unknown to the caster, as well as
allowing him to transport more than
Heavy encumbrance.
Modifiers: The spell is at a -1 penalty per yard of obstruction thickness;
there is no penalty if the obstruction is
half a yard thick or less. The GM
should not tell the player what the
penalty is; he should simply tell him
whether the spell failed or not.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 2 per 10 square feet of door
size. 2 to maintain. For reference, a
modern door is usually about seven
feet high and three feet wide. A door
created for 2 energy would have to be
significantly smaller.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Teleport and any one
“Walk Through” spell.

This is also a Movement spell.

Cost: As described above; minimum
cost 3.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Trace Teleport.

Item
Any. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 700.


Seek Gate
Information
Tells the caster the direction and
approximate distance of the nearest
gate. Any known gates may be excluded if the caster specifically mentions
them before beginning.
Modifiers: Long-distance modifiers
(p. 14), -2 if the gate is currently
closed, -5 if seeking a gate’s arrival
point, -10 if seeking a gate leading to a
specific destination. Note that the gate
itself may be Scryguarded or under a
Conceal Magic spell.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Seek
Magic, and one spell from each of 10
colleges.

Item
A forked stick. Energy cost to create:
100.

Scry Gate
Regular
When cast on an open gate, this
spell allows images, sounds and smells
to come through it from the other
side, just as if one were peering
through an open window. No corresponding “window” opens at the gate’s
other end.
If the gate leads into an area protected by Scrywall, the Scrywall gets
to resist the Scry Gate. Sense
Observation may pick up the Scry
Gate. Scryfool cannot fool Scry Gate,
however.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Seek Gate.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 200. (b) A gate may also
be made to display its destination permanently; this is determined when the
gate is created, and adds 100 energy to
the creation cost. The gate’s creator
must know Scry Gate at a level equal
to or greater than Create Gate.

Control Gate
Regular; Resisted by the Gate
Forces an open gate to close, a
closed gate to open, or tilts and

displaces the subject gate as the caster
wishes. Closing a permanent gate does
not destroy it; closing a temporary one
does (to destroy a permanent gate,
use Remove Enchantment).
This spell moves gates
at up to 3 yards per second. Control Gate can
also be used to
“choose” a particular
destination of a multiple-destination Gate
(see Create Gate).
Once control is
relinquished, the Gate
reverts to its “programmed” state, moving back
to its original place at top speed and
by the shortest path.
If several Control Gate spells are
active at once on a single Gate, the latter resists them with a single roll, control going to the spell with the largest
margin of success.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Seek
Gate.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 300.

Create Gate (VH)
Regular
Creates a temporary magical portal
leading to another place, time, or
dimension – effectively, a hole in time
and space from which those who enter
will teleport, timeport, and/or planeshift to a predetermined destination.
The more “distance” between the gate
and its destination, the greater the
energy cost and skill penalty.
To determine the skill penalty,
combine the penalties for the equivalent Teleport, Timeport, or Plane Shift
spell(s). To determine the energy cost,
combine the energy costs from the
same spell(s), and multiply the cost by
10. This cost will permit the caster to
create a gate of any size up to a 3’ ¥ 6’
doorway (or equivalent surface area).
Larger gates are no more difficult, but
cost proportionately more energy.
This spell may also be used to
enchant a permanent gate, in which
case a few more considerations
become important. The caster(s) must
specify if it will be always open,
always closed, or open and closed
when certain conditions are fulfilled
(opens only on the hour of the full
moon, opens only when someone utters a password,
etc).
Several gates may
share a single location. Only one of
them may be open at
any time, so it is common to have them
cycle in time, giving the
net effect of a single gate
leading to a choice of destinations. They must be created
separately, but otherwise behave as a
single gate. Permanent gates can be
“anchored” to a physical gateway; they
then resist displacement or destruction at a bonus given by the gateway’s
DR.
When a gate has a Timeport component, the creator must specify if the
gate merely displaces its users in time
by a fixed amount (1 year into the past,
for example) or if it sends its users to a
specific, unchanging point in time
(December 25, 1066, say). In the latter
case, since subjects that step into the
gate at various departure times can’t
all arrive at the same time, the gate
either “drifts” slowly in time so as to
space the arrivals at least a second
apart, or the various subjects arrive in
different “pasts” (GM’s decision).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 10 times the total energy cost
for the Teleport, Timeport, and Plane
Shift spells involved (more for larger
gates). Same cost to maintain. Making
the gate permanent instead costs 100
times as much.
Time to cast: 1 second per energy
point.
Prerequisites: Control Gate. The
caster must also know Teleport to create a gate leading to another place,
Timeport to create a gate leading to
another time, or Plane Shift to create
a gate leading to another plane of
existence.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b)
A stylus or paintbrush. Usable only by
a mage, who must draw an outline of
a doorway on a solid surface. Energy
cost to create: 900.

Slow Time (VH)
Area; Special Resistance
Time in the area slows down. Any
unwilling beings within the area
when the spell is cast resist with the
highest of their ST and IQ; they must
all fail for the spell to take effect.
Objects and spells may cross the
area’s edge without being hampered.
Beings crossing into or out of the area
must roll vs. IQ or be mentally
stunned.
Duration: 1 minute (outside time).
Base cost: One-half normal temporal “speed” costs 2, one-third costs 3,
one-fourth costs 4, and so on (no
limit, but see the Suspend Time spell,
below). Same costs to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, IQ 13+,
and at least two spells from each of 10
different colleges.

Item
Staff or timepiece. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Accelerate Time (VH)
Area; Special Resistance
The opposite of Slow Time. Time in
the affected area speeds up.
Otherwise, all of the rules for crossing
the area’s edge, resistance, and so on,
are as per Slow Time.
Powerstones recharge at outside
rates, so Accelerate Time does not
speed up Powerstone recharge. Of
course, relative rest-time can be
increased, permitting mages to regain
lost FP more rapidly.
Duration: 1 minute (outside time).
Base cost: 2 for double, 3 for triple,
4 for quadruple, and so on (no limit,
but see the Time Out spell, below).
Same costs to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, IQ 13+,
and at least two spells from each of 10
different colleges.

Item
Staff or timepiece. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Hide Object
Regular
The subject (which must be
nonliving) disappears into an other-
dimensional space from which it can be recalled at will. Failure to maintain the spell causes the object to reappear in mid-air next to the caster. If the subject is being held by a living being, the holder can resist the spell with his IQ.
Seeker won’t find objects hidden by this method; Trace loses touch for the duration of the Hide Object, regaining it when the object reap- pears in this world. Teleport Shield will oppose this spell (the original margin of success of the Hide Object spell would need to be 5 or better for the object to reappear within an area affected by a base casting of Teleport Shield, for example). The object reap- pears in the caster’s grasp or in his immediate vicinity (caster’s choice).
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 per pound of object weight to cast. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: baskdjasdhj


Sanctuary (VH)
Special
Opens a door-sized portal to a
pocket dimension. The portal closes
immediately after the caster passes
through it (others may pass through it
first, of course). The portal leads to a
small dimly lit room with blank walls
and no visible exits. When the caster
wishes to leave, he simply concentrates and a portal appears on one of
the walls, leading back to his original
point of departure. The space can have
a size up to that of a cube equal to the
caster’s skill, in yards, on a side.
The real world completely loses
touch with the occupants of the pocket dimension; Seeker won’t find them,
Trace will lose them for the duration
(but will pick them up as soon as they
step back out) and so on. Of course,
the reverse is also true.

Long-term visits to the pocket
dimension will require the creation of
air, food, and water (and decent
lighting, for comfort’s sake), as well as
the disposal of wastes. This is slightly
complicated by the fact that the pocket dimension is low-mana; all spellcasting is at -5, and the Recover
Energy spell doesn’t work.
Should the spell expire or the caster lose consciousness, all the room’s
contents reappear as if teleported; its
occupants each take 1d of damage
and are physically stunned if they fail
a Body Sense roll. This also happens
to anyone who is foolish enough not
to exit before the caster!
If the caster wishes to return to the
real world, but not to his point of
departure, he may cast an appropriate
magical transport spell from the
pocket dimension as if he were casting it from the departure point (if he
is willing to take the risk of a lowmana casting).
Note: This “default” description of
the pocket universe created by this
spell should by no means be taken as
gospel. A less bare-bones version
might include opulent (but magical
and temporary) furnishings and features, illusionary windows, and so on.
In some worlds, this will be determined by the GM’s views on alternate
dimensions. In others, the details of
sanctuary dimensions might be conscious, or unconscious, reflections of
the mage’s personality.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 5 to cast. 5 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Hideaway and
Teleport.

Item
Staff, wand, jewelry, or door.
Usable only by mages. Energy cost to
create: 2,000.

Suspend Time (VH)
Area; Resisted by IQ
Time is suspended in the area; relative to the outside world, the occupants of a time-suspended area will
not move, breathe, age, or even think.
As far as the affected beings are
concerned, no time elapses for the
spell’s duration. One moment they
were having tea in a pleasant spring

meadow, and the next moment winter
has come outside the circle of grass
they are sitting in . . .
Any unwilling beings within the
area when the spell is cast resist with
IQ. They must all fail for the spell to
take effect.
From the outside, the area appears
to be surrounded by a perfectly reflective surface, which nothing (including
magic and magical beings) can cross.
Objects thrown at it bounce off. Any
spell requiring concentration and
lying outside the area immediately
lapses if its caster is caught inside.
Likewise, any outside spell whose
maintenance comes due during the
suspended time also lapses (but see
Maintain Spell, p. 128).
Duration: 1 day (outside time).
Base cost: 5 to cast. 5 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Slow
Time.

Item
Staff or timepiece. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 2,500.

Time Out (VH)
Area
The area and all within it are temporar- ily removed from the time stream; the effect is equivalent to having the area’s time acceler- ated infinitely. Unlike Suspend Time, this spell can only be cast from the inside, cen- tered on the caster (the spell ends as soon as he touches its edge). Should the caster die alone in the area, the spell will never end! The caster and any objects caught in the area would simply seem to vanish from the time stream.
As far as outside observers are con- cerned, the area “ages” instantaneously (which may or may not be perceptible). One moment five ogres were attacking
the party while their wizard cast a
spell, and the next moment the ogres
were dead, the party magically
healed, and everybody was in a different position and drinking rum to
celebrate.
From the inside, the area is
bounded by a wall (and covered by a
ceiling) of utter blackness. Anyone or
anything touching the edge of the
area is immediately expelled from the
area, back into normal time. This
causes an automatic mental stun to
anyone other than the caster. Missiles
of any sort can be thrown blindly out
of the area (see Shooting Blind,
p. B389) but not into it. Note that,
since all missiles fired out of the area
will emerge at the same outside time,
an archer could create an impressive
burst of arrows by simply firing casually for a few subjective hours . . .
Spells involving the outside simply
fail. Any spell requiring concentration and lying inside the area lapses
immediately if its caster is left outside. Likewise, any inside spell whose
maintenance comes due during the
Time Out lapses unless its caster is
also inside.

The “flow” of mana into the Timed
Out area is effectively nil.
Powerstones
won’t
recharge,
enchantment is impossible, etc.
Mages still recover lost energy (the
physical consequences of manipulating mana go away regardless of the
local mana supply), but GMs may
decree that spells cost much more, or
are impossible, within the timestopped area (since the power must
be drawn entirely from the caster’s
personal life-force). This is entirely
dependent on the GM’s view of mana
in his setting.
Duration: An instant (outside
time). Within the area, the caster and
any other occupants have as much
time as they need.
Base cost: 5.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Accelerate Time.

Item
Staff or timepiece. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 2,500.


Body-Reading
Information; Resisted by Will
Creates in the mind of the caster a
visual and tactile “image” of the interior of the subject’s body. Useful for
diagnosing pain or illness of uncertain
origins, this spell reveals organ ruptures and internal bleeding, bone fractures – even the sex of an unborn
child. Use Regular range modifiers.
Essentially, this is the magical equivalent of a detailed series of X-rays; what
the caster can do with the information
gained depends on his medical skills.
The spell does not reveal the exact
nature of any poisons or diseases that
may be affecting the subject, but it
gives a +2 to any subsequent Poisons
or Diagnosis roll. The caster must
touch the subject.
Modifiers: -2 if the subject is of a different species than the caster (an Elven
wizard reading a human subject, for
instance), -4 or worse if totally alien!
Cost: 2.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisite: Sense Life or Awaken.

Item
Headgear or jewelry. Works only
on wearer. Energy cost to create: 200.

Detect Poison
Area; Information
As listed under Protection and
Warning Spells, p. 166.

Final Rest
Regular
When cast on a dead body, this
spell renders the subject immune to all
Necromantic magic. The spirit of the
deceased cannot be summoned, nor
can the body be animated (or
Resurrected). It has no physical effect
on the body. The spell may be cast at
any time after the subject dies, but
there is a cumulative -1 penalty for
each month that the subject has been
dead, to a maximum of -10. Any given
caster may attempt the spell only once
per subject.
This spell has no effect on a living
person, and will not affect the undead
who have already risen.
In many settings, this spell is an
intrinsic part of funeral rites, and may
be restricted to the clergy. GMs may
wish to change the prerequisite from
Magery to Power Investiture or
Blessed. In other settings, this spell is
unnecessary; ordinary nonmagical
funeral rites are sufficient to safeguard the dead from necromancy.
It is usually assumed that this spell
functions by sending the soul of the
deceased from the mortal plane into
the presence of their deity. Some, however (usually members of one deathcult or another), believe that this spell
works by destroying the disembodied
spirits of the dead!
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 20.
Time to cast: Minimum 10 minutes.
This spell is always cast ceremonially.
Prerequisite: Magery 1 or Spirit
Empathy. “Holy” persons may be able
to cast this spell without either prerequisite.

Item
This spell may be consecrated into
funerary regalia. Energy cost: 1,200.

Lend Energy
Regular
Restores the subject’s lost Fatigue
Points, at an energy cost to the caster.
Cannot increase the subject’s FP score
above its normal maximum.
Cost: Any amount; the energy spent
by the caster goes to the subject as
restored FP (e.g., if the caster spends 5
energy, the subject regains 5 lost FP).
Casting cost is not reduced by high
skill.
Prerequisite: Magery 1 or Empathy
(p. B51).

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 100.

Lend Vitality
Regular
Temporarily restores the subject’s
lost Hit Points, at an energy cost to the
caster. Cannot increase the subject’s
HP score above its normal maximum.
Since restored HP vanish after one
hour and the spell cannot be maintained, this spell is only a stopgap
measure.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Any amount; the energy spent
by the caster goes to the subject as
restored HP (e.g., if the caster spends
5 energy, the subject regains 5 lost
HP). Casting cost is not reduced by
high skill. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisite: Lend Energy.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 250.

Share Energy
Regular
The caster makes his FP available
to another wizard’s spell casting. The
caster may only cast this spell on himself. He must specify who can draw FP
from him in the next second – nobody
else may do so. More than one wizard
may be specified, and a limit of 5 FP
may be drawn in a single second. The
caster may specify a lower limit! HP
may not be used to cast this spell.
If a specified wizard does not draw
FP before the caster’s next turn, the
Share Energy spell expires, costing the
caster one FP. The wizard casting the
other spell does not have to be aware
of the Share spell’s existence. As he
casts his spell, he will feel an outside
energy attempting to aid him – he may
yield to that or deny it, paying the cost
himself.
A spell can draw power from only
one Share spell. If more than one
Share spell is cast, use the closest one;
roll randomly if two are equally close.
Duration: The FP must be used in a
spell that turn. Cannot be maintained.
Cost: Twice the amount actually
used by the wizard who draws the FP.
The energy spent by the caster goes to
power another wizard’s spell. FP
beyond that needed by the spell is not
transferred to the other wizard – use
Lend Energy to do that. The cost to
cast this spell is never reduced by high
skill. A minimum of 1 FP is always
spent when casting this spell.
Prerequisite: Lend Energy.

Recover Energy
Special
Rest and recover Fatigue Points
more quickly than normal by drawing
energy from the mana around him. A
normal person recovers 1 FP every 10
minutes. A mage who knows this spell
at skill 15 or higher recovers 1 FP
every 5 minutes. A mage who knows
this spell at skill 20 or higher recovers
1 FP every 2 minutes. No further
improvement is possible. Note that
this spell works on the caster himself;
it cannot restore FP to others.
The mage must rest quietly, but no
ritual or die roll is required. While
resting, he can maintain ordinary
spells, but not those that require
concentration.
This spell does not function in lowor no-mana areas.
Cost: None.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Lend
Energy.

Item
Jewelry. Permits wearer to recover
as though he had this spell at level
equal to item’s Power; always on. A
very rare item! Energy cost to create:
1,000; must be made of alloyed gold
and platinum (minimum value of a
small ring $500).

Relieve Sickness
Regular; Resisted by subject spell
Temporarily relieves a subject of
any sickness symptoms he may have
been displaying (fever, dizziness, rash,
cough, etc.). The spells Sickness and
Drunkenness get to resist. Note that
only the symptoms are cured. Relieve
Sickness will sober a drunk for the
duration – but for a permanent cure,
use Neutralize Poison.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Lend Vitality.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 250.

Share Vitality
Regular
The caster heals another’s injuries by transferring them to himself, losing as many HP as the subject heals. If the subject had a crippled limb, it will remain so – only the HP loss is healed. Likewise, the injury applied to the caster will not cripple him (although it could certainly put him into uncon- sciousness or even kill him; the spell includes no “safety net” for overly kind wizards). The caster does not suffer the normal skill penalty for spending HP to cast spells, nor is he penalized for recasting on the same subject.
Duration: Permanent; the caster can be healed of his new injuries through normal or magical means.
Cost: No energy need be expended; high skill only affects casting time.
Time to cast: 1 second per HP transferred.
Prerequisite: Lend Vitality.

Remove Contagion
Area
Purifies the subject area of conta- gious disease-causing agents – microbes, disease spirits, foul air, etc. – rendering it sterile and free from infec- tion. This spell can be used to cleanse and sterilize anything from a disease- cult temple to an operating theatre. It will not cure or relieve disease in living creatures; it serves only to cleanse and purify objects and surfaces.
Infectious areas or objects treated with Remove Contagion cannot serve as a source of contagion (see Contagion, p. B443) until reinfected.
Duration: Until disease-causing agents return to the affected area.
Base cost: 3.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Decay, Clean, or Cure
Disease.

Stop Spasm
Regular
As listed under Body Control Spells, p. 35.

Item


Awaken
Area
Renders the subject(s) awake and
alert. It instantly counters the effects of
stunning. If the subject is very fatigued
(less than 1/3 basic FP), this spell renders him alert for an hour but costs
him 1 FP at the end of that time. It has
no effect on those with 0 or fewer FP.
Sleeping or unconscious subjects get a
HT roll to awaken, at a bonus equal to
the caster’s margin of success. A subject rolls at -3 if unconscious due to
injury, at -6 if drugged.
Base cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Lend Vitality.

Item

Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. Subject must be touched by
item. Energy cost to create: 400.


Resist Disease
Regular
The subject is immune to diseases
for the duration of the spell, as per the
Immunity to Disease advantage
(p. B80). This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Remove Contagion or
Vigor.

Item
(a) Jewelry. Always on; the wearer
is immune to diseases. A rare and
prized item! Energy cost to create:
1,000 for an item that resists one specific disease, 2,500 for one that resists
all diseases. (b) Jewelry. Always on;
prevents the wearer from spreading
any disease he may have. “Lepers’
Cords” are an example of this item.
Energy cost to create: 250.

Resist Poison
Regular
The subject becomes immune to
poisons for the duration of the spell.
For some very persistent poisons, this
is only a delay of the inevitable, since
traces of the poison may still be in the
subject’s system when the spell ends!
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Vigor.

Item
Jewelry. The item must bear a picture of a unicorn. Always on; wearer is
immune to poison. A rare and prized
item! Energy cost to create: 500 for an
item that resists one specific poison,
4,000 for one that resists all poisons.

Stop Bleeding
Regular
The subject stops bleeding immediately, as if bandaged by someone with
the First Aid skill (p. B195). This
restores 1 HP, and prevents further HP
loss from bleeding if the optional
bleeding rules (p. B420) are in effect.
The subject of this spell may not
subsequently benefit from further
bandaging of the same wounds.
This spell may also be used to stabilize a mortal wound (p. B423), at a
substantially higher cost.
Duration: Permanent, although
later injuries will bleed normally.
Cost: 1 to stop bleeding on a normal wound; 10 to stabilize a mortal
wound.
Prerequisite: Lend Vitality.

Item

Any item. The item must bear a
picture of a pelican. It prevents its
wearer from bleeding and from suffering mortal wounds. Energy cost to
create: 500.

Wand or staff decorated in a snake
pattern. The item must touch the
subject. Usable only by mages, or by
nonmages with Physician skill 20 or
higher. Energy cost to create: 1,500.

Minor Healing
Restores up to 3 HP to the subject. Does not eliminate disease or poison, but will cure damage caused by these things.
This spell is risky if used more than once per day by the same caster on the same subject. If you try, roll at -3 for the first repetition, -6 for the second, and so on.
If you have the Physician skill at level 15 or higher, a critical failure with this spell counts only as an ordi- nary failure – unless you are trying the spell more than once per day on the same subject.
Cost: 1 to 3. The same amount is restored to the subject.
Prerequisite: Lend Vitality.


Great Healing (VH)
Regular
Restores all of the subject’s missing HP. Does not eliminate disease or poi- son, nor does it restore crippled or missing body parts, but it can heal HP lost to any of these things.
A given subject can only benefit from this spell once per day, whether cast by the same caster or by a different caster each time.
If you have the Physician skill at level 15 or higher, a critical failure with this spell counts only as an ordinary failure.
Cost: 20. One try per day per subject.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Major Healing.


Major Healing (VH)
Restores up to 8 HP to the subject. Does not eliminate disease or poison, but will cure damage caused by these things.
Otherwise, this spell functions just like Minor Healing: it is at -3 per cast- ing on the same subject in one day, and Physician skill at level 15 or high- er will mitigate the effects of a critical failure.
The penalties for repeated casting accrue separately for Minor Healing and Major Healing. For instance, a caster could cast both spells on the same subject in the same day at no penalty.
Cost: 1 to 4. Twice the amount spent is restored to the subject.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Minor Healing.

Cure Disease
Regular
Eliminates one type of disease or
infection from the body of the subject.
A successful Diagnosis roll (by the
caster or another) should precede the
casting; if not, spell use is at -5! Does
not cure any damage the illness has
done to the subject; the spell just
eliminates the underlying sickness.
Duration: The illness is gone, but
the subject isn’t immune forever . . .
Cost: 4.
Time to cast: 10 minutes. One try.
Prerequisites: Relieve Sickness and
Major Healing.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. The item must touch the subject. Usable only by mages. Energy cost
to create: 800 to cure one specific disease, or 1,500 for an item that cures
any disease.

Neutralize Poison
Regular
Eliminates all traces of one chosen
poison from the body of the subject. A
successful Poisons roll (by the caster
or another character) should precede
the casting in order to identify the poison being treated; if not, spell use is at
-5! This spell is of no use against
alchemical elixirs other than those
that do direct damage. Does not cure
existing damage – the spell just
removes the remaining poison,
avoiding any further damage.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 5.
Time to cast: 30 seconds (beware
fast-acting poisons!). One try.
Prerequisites: Either Magery 3 and
Test Food or Cure Disease.

Item
Staff or wand decorated in a snake
pattern. Usable only by a mage or a
nonmage with Physician-20 or higher.
The item must touch the subject. Cost
to create: 400 for an item that cures
one specific poison, 1,500 for an item
that cures any poison.

Instant Neutralize Poison (VH)
Regular
As Neutralize Poison, but works
instantly. A Poisons roll is not required
for successful use of this spell!
Cost: 8. One try per day.
Prerequisites: Magery
Neutralize Poison.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. The item must touch the subject. Usable only by a mage or a nonmage with Physician-20 or higher.
Energy cost to create: 800 for an item
that neutralizes one specific poison,
3,000 for an item that will neutralize
any poison.

Relieve Addiction
Regular
Partially replaces a “daily dose” of
some drug required by the subject.
The subject will still feel the psychological effects of missing a dose (that
is, a Will-modified HT roll is still
required to count the day toward
shaking off the addiction), but will not
suffer any physical damage from
withdrawal.
Modifiers: This spell is at a -4 penalty if the caster casts it on himself, and
at a cumulative -4 per consecutive
daily casting on the same subject
(thus, it gets harder and harder for the
spell to replace the drug). In addition,
the withdrawal penalty inherent to the
drug is applied to any casting!
Duration: 1 day.
Cost: 6. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Neutralize Poison.

Relieve Madness
Regular
Temporarily restores a subject’s sanity, relieving him from a single Delusion, Phobia, Compulsion, or spell-induced Madness (caster’s choice). The Madness and Permanent Madness spells get to resist.
This is also a Mind Control spell.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Lend Vitality and
Wisdom.

Restore Hearing
Regular
Similar to Restore Sight, but for
Hearing. The eardrums or other
organs of hearing must not be
completely missing.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Equal to half of the restored
Hearing score (Per + Acute Hearing);
half to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Minor Healing and
either Keen Hearing or Strike Deaf.

Item
Jewelry (earrings are especially
appropriate) or clothing. Always on.
Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Restore Sight
Regular
Temporarily restores the subject’s sight, regardless of what caused the loss (if the loss of sight is magical in nature, however, the responsible spell gets to resist). The eyes must not be completely missing (that requires Regeneration). For a permanent cure, use Restoration.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Equal to half of the restored Vision score (Per + Acute Vision); half to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Minor Healing and either Keen Vision or Strike Blind.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 850.

Relieve Madness
Regular
Temporarily restores a subject’s sanity, relieving him from a single Delusion, Phobia, Compulsion, or spell-induced Madness (caster’s choice). The Madness and Permanent Madness spells get to resist.
This is also a Mind Control spell.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Lend Vitality and
Wisdom.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost to create: 850.


Restore Memory
Regular
Used to cure the victims of memory loss, either mundane or magical.
The spell restores one forgotten fact or
skill at a time. The Forgetfulness spell
resists; Permanent Forgetfulness
resists at +5. This spell will not permit
the subject to recall something that he
never actually memorized in the first
place (but see the Recall spell, p. 106).
The spell is risky if used more than
once per day on the same subject:
each repeat casting is at a cumulative
-3 penalty. A critical failure is very hazardous – the memory being sought is
destroyed forever, and the subject is
plunged into a frightening sequence of
buried memories lasting 2d minutes.
This causes a Fright Check at a -6
penalty.
If the caster has Psychology skill at
15 or higher, a “critical failure” on this
spell counts as an ordinary failure –
unless he has already tried the spell
more than once that day on the same
subject.
Duration: The memory is recovered permanently.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisites: Awaken and IQ 11 or
higher.

Item
Wand or staff; the item must bear a
picture of an elephant. The item must
touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 600.

Restore Speech
Regular
Similar to Restore Sight, but for Speech. The tongue and vocal cords cannot be completely missing.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Minor Healing and
either Great Voice or Strike Dumb.

Stop Paralysis
Regular
Counters temporary paralysis (due
to spell, paralysis gun, etc.). An ongoing spell (such as Paralyze Limb or
Total Paralysis) gets a resistance roll.
Cost: 1 for a single limb. 2 for the
whole body.
Prerequisites: Either Minor Healing
and Paralyze Limb or Major Healing.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 200.

Relieve Paralysis
Regular
Temporarily restores a subject’s use
of his paralyzed or crippled limbs. The
limbs must not, of course, be completely missing (that requires
Regeneration). Since limbs wither with
disuse, the GM should use his judgment and assess DX and ST penalties
to the use of such restored limbs.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Equal to the crippling threshold for the limbs affected. Same to
maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.

Item
Jewelry or clothing. Always on.
Energy cost to create: 200 per point of
crippling
threshold
effectively
restored (should the wearer’s crippling
threshold be higher than the capacity
of the item, assess the difference as a
penalty to DX and ST for that limb).

Restoration (VH)
Regular
Regain the use of one crippled limb
or damaged eye – also restores lost
hearing, smell, etc. Will not work on a
lost limb or eye – that requires
Regeneration. (If a limb has been
amputated and is intact, you may try
Restoration within the hour, at -5 to
skill, to put it back on!)
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 15. One try.
Time to cast: 1 minute to cast the
spell; 1 month before the process of
restoration is complete. The part may
not be used at all until the month has
passed; it simply won’t work, even
though it may appear to be healthy.
Prerequisites: Either Major Healing
or any two of Relieve Paralysis and the
various “Restore” spells.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. Usable only by mages.
Subject must be touched by item.
Energy cost to create: 2,000.

Instant Restoration (VH)
Regular
As Restoration, but works instantly.
Cost: 50. One try.
Prerequisites: Magery
Restoration.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. Usable only by mages. The
item must touch the subject. Energy
cost to create: 2,500.

Regeneration (VH)
Regular
Regrow one lost limb or eye.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 20. One try.
Time to cast: 1 minute to cast the
spell; 1 month before the process of
regeneration is complete. The regenerating part may not be used at all until
the month has passed.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Restoration.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. Usable only by mages. The
item must touch the subject. Energy
cost to create: 3,000.

Instant Regeneration (VH)
Regular
As Regeneration, but works instantly.
Cost: 80. One try.
Prerequisites: Magery
Regeneration.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. Usable only by mages. The
item must touch the subject. Energy
cost to create: 4,000.

Cure Radiation
Regular
As listed under Technological Spells,
p. 182.

Cleansing
Regular; Special Resistance
Cleanses the subject of any foreign
matter in his tissues, including cactus
or porcupine spines, arrowheads,
barbs, bullets, splinters, etc. Also eliminates external (but not internal) bacteria and parasites. Has no effect
against diseases, poisons or drugs.
The subject must be willing or totally
helpless (e.g., bound or unconscious)
and the caster must touch him.
“Foreign matter” that is somehow
integral to the subject (gold teeth, steel
plates or rods, glass eyes, cyberware,
and so on) must be excluded by the
caster or it may be destroyed as well!
If the caster is careless (or malicious),
each item resists separately with
HT+5 of the subject.
Cost: 2 to cleanse a hand or foot, 4
for a torso or limb, 6 for an entire body.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Minor Healing and
Purify Earth.


Healing Slumber
Regular; Automatic Resistance
Subject falls into a deep restorative
sleep, and heals 1 HP for every hour of
rest. Fatigue is recovered at double the
normal rate.
The subject wakes once completely
healed, or after 8 hours have passed;
any fatigue from lost sleep is also completely recovered after that time.
Otherwise, he can only be awakened
by a word from the caster, an injury or
the Awaken spell (or Remove Curse,
Counterspell, etc.). An unwilling
subject resists automatically.
Duration: Up to 8 hours (maximum
recovery of 8 HP per day).
Cost: 6. For a cost of 10, the speed
of recovery is doubled. Maximum
recovery is unchanged.

Jewelry. Always on; the item prevents aging while it is worn.
Kingdoms have been toppled for possession of such things . . . Energy cost
to create: 10,000.

Item
Wand or staff, decorated in a snake
pattern. The item must touch the
subject. Usable only by a mage or a
nonmage with Surgery-15 or higher.
Energy cost to create: 250.

Suspended Animation
Regular; Resisted by HT
Holds the subject in apparent
sleep, indefinitely. The effects of severe
bleeding, disease, age, etc. are all halted while the spell is in effect. The subject requires neither food nor air, but
can still be harmed by fire, weapons,
and other natural hazards.
Duration: Remains in effect until
broken (the Awaken spell works well).
Cost: 6.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Sleep and at least
four Healing spells.

Item
(a) Jewelry, arrow, or clothing.
Always on; the item puts its wearer in
suspended animation instantly. The
spell lifts immediately when the item is
removed. Energy cost to create: 2,000.
(b) Crypt, coffin, etc. Always on; puts
the occupant in suspended animation.
Energy cost to create: 2,000 per humansized space.

Item

Youth (VH)
Regular
Removes one year from the subject’s age. Any attribute levels lost in
that period are automatically
regained. Does not affect memories,
skills, injuries, etc., gained during the
“lost” months.
Duration: Subject starts aging
again immediately.
Cost: 100. One try per month.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Halt
Aging.

Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Sleep, and
Minor Healing.

Item
(a) Wand or staff, decorated in a
snake pattern. The item must touch
the subject. Usable only by a mage or
a nonmage with Physician-15 or higher. Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b) Any
item. If the wearer is willing to sleep
(or faints from fatigue or injury), the
item activates. The wearer wakes if the
item is removed or once the spell lapses (if the wearer’s HP is still negative,
see Recovering From Unconsciousness,
p. B423). Energy cost to create: 900.

Halt Aging (VH)
Regular
Stops the subject from aging for
one month. Cannot be cast again until
the first spell wears off.
Duration: One month.
Cost: 20. One try per week.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
eight Healing spells.

Resurrection (VH)
Regular
Brings the subject back to life, provided that the body, or most of it, is
available. This is the GM’s decision;
note that a body that has reached
-10¥HP is by definition too damaged
for resurrection. The resurrected subject has FP and HP 0, and must regain
FP and HP in the normal fashion. All
his limbs will be intact, regardless of
the injuries that killed him. The caster’s skill is at a -1 penalty for each full
day between the subject’s death and
the beginning of the spell.
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: Permanent, until you’re
killed again . . .
Cost: 300. One try.
Time to cast: 2 hours.
Prerequisites: Instant Regeneration
and Summon Spirit.

Item
There are persistent rumors of a
magic item that will bring the dead to
life, but nothing specific is known.



Simple Illusion
Area
Creates a purely visual image that
can be seen by anyone in view of the
area it occupies. It may be a single
object or an entire scene. It may move
to a different area, or change size or
shape up to its maximum area, if the
caster concentrates. Any sapient creature can dispel it by “disbelieving” –
taking a Concentrate action and making a successful Will roll. The illusion is
automatically dispelled by any attack,
any other spell except Control Illusion,
or the touch of any sapient creature.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Caster must be able
to see and have IQ 11 or better.

Phantom Flame
Area
As listed under Fire Spells, p. 73.


Complex Illusion
Area
As Simple Illusion, but affects
hearing as well as sight. It is not automatically dispelled by a spell or touch;
however, any amount of actual
damage will dispel the illusion.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Sound and Simple
Illusion.

Perfect Illusion
Area
As Complex Illusion, but affects all
the senses except touch; your hand
will go through it. It cannot be dispelled except by Dispel Magic or
Dispel Illusion. Any damage at all will
temporarily disturb the illusion,
revealing it for what it is without
dispelling it.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 3 to cast. Half that to
maintain. For double cost, even the sense of touch will be fooled, though you cannot “really” warm yourself from an illusionary fire.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Complex Illusion.

Illusion Shell
Regular
This illusion makes a chosen object
look, sound, and feel different. The
base object must be of the appropriate
size and shape. The illusion may be
disbelieved, but is otherwise stable.
However, it will not move about unless
the underlying object moves. Damage
done by the underlying object is unaffected. For example, an illusion shell
of a horse could be cast over a wooden horse. It would stamp, nicker, and
smell like a horse, but could not be
ridden! Concentration is not required
to maintain the illusion.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 for an object small enough
to be hand-held, or 2 for larger
objects. Half that cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Simple Illusion.

Item
For 200 times the base cost, the
spell can be made permanent; it will
not be disbelieved!

Illusion Disguise
Regular
This illusion disguises a living
being. The caster must first create the
illusion (using any basic Illusion
spell). The Illusion Disguise spell then
superimposes the illusion over the
subject, so it covers him and moves
with him. The better the Illusion spell
used, the better and more permanent
the disguise; a Perfect Illusion
Disguise even fools the sense of touch.
Concentration is not required to maintain the disguise. The illusion disguise
counts as only a single spell “on.”
Duration: Until the illusion ends.
Cost: 3. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisite: Simple Illusion.

Item
Jewelry or clothing; the item casts
an Illusion Disguise (specified when
the item is enchanted) over the wearer. Energy cost to create: 150 Simple,
300 Complex, 500 Perfect Illusion.
There is no energy cost to the wearer!

Independence
Area
This spell can be used with any
controlled creation or illusion. It lets
the caster “program” the creation or
illusion to move about, speak (if it can
make sounds), and even react in predetermined ways. All this is done with
no further concentration on the caster’s part; it does not count as a separate spell “on.” If faced with something for which it is not “programmed,” it may do nothing or (if an
illusion) simply vanish, at the GM’s
whim.
Duration: As long as the creation or
illusion lasts.
Base cost: 2. Does not require
maintenance.
Time to cast: As long as it takes the
casting player to describe the instructions to the GM, or to read them aloud
if they are in writing (writing them
down will save arguments!). Complex
instructions take a long time to cast.
Minimum 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Simple Illusion.

Know Illusion
Information
Tells whether the subject is either
an illusion or creation, and if so, just
what kind it is. The caster must be
able to see the subject.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Simple Illusion.

Control Illusion
Regular; Resisted by subject spell
Take control of an illusion that someone else has cast. If your spell succeeds, you must pay any further energy costs to maintain the illusion. If you fail, the illusion still belongs to the original caster. This spell does not affect an Illusion Disguise. If the spell is cast over something that is not an illusion, the energy cost is still spent
but the spell has no effect.
Duration: Once established, con- trol is permanent unless someone else takes control.
Cost: 1.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Perfect Illusion.


Dispel Illusion
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Dispels any Illusion or Illusion
Disguise. Does not affect creations.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Control Illusion.

Item
Wand or staff; the item must touch
the subject illusion. Energy cost to
create: 400.

Inscribe
Area; Resisted by Will
Creates an inscription (either writing or images) on any surface.
Appropriate specializations of Artist
(Calligraphy, Illumination, etc.) should
be used to assess the aesthetics of the
result. The image can be as stylish as
the caster desires: letters of silver
flame, simple block-lettering, reflected
light on the surface of water, and so on.
The inscription is integral to the subject’s surface, fading only when the
spell is canceled or expires. Any living
things to be inscribed get to resist.
This is also a Making and Breaking
spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. Minimum 2.
Prerequisites: Simple Illusion and
Copy.

Item



Phantom (VH)
Area
Like Perfect Illusion, but a phan- tom can impede movement and inflict real damage. The first time any living creature physically contacts a phantom, roll a Quick Contest between the caster’s effective skill and the being’s IQ. If the caster loses, then the phantom is treated as a Perfect Illusion for all purposes with regards to that character.
If the caster wins, the phantom has substance and may proceed to strike,
grapple, shove, and so on as if it were
real. A phantom may have any ST and
DX up to the mage’s skill with the spell
for the purposes of contests, damage
inflicted, and so on.
When the spell is first cast, the GM
should note the margin of success. If
a single attack on the phantom inflicts
this amount (or more) of basic damage, the phantom is immediately dispelled. Any spells that work on illusions (Dispel Illusion, Control
Illusion, Independence, etc.) work on
phantoms.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 5. Half that to maintain.
For a base cost of 9, the phantom can
have twice the normal ST (DX is
unchanged).
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Perfect
Illusion, Hinder, and Apportation.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 300;
half cost for an item that will create a
single, creator-determined phantom.

Initiative
Area
This spell can be cast on any creation or illusion the caster controls,
giving it a semblance of intelligence in
order to act on its own initiative. The
subject is totally loyal to the caster,
and obeys him (or anyone else the
caster orders it to heed) to the best of
its ability.
The base cost of the spell is based
on what knowledge the caster grants
the subject. Creations start with their
own DX and IQ as listed in the spell
description. For the purposes of this
spell, Illusions and Phantoms start
with IQ 0 and DX 8. The subject’s DX
and IQ may be raised as high as the
caster’s. The subject may also be given
the caster’s skills – every skill granted
is known at the same relative level as
the caster. Illusions and creations with
Initiative may use defaults on any
skill.
Once the spell is cast, the subject
acts on its own until the spell expires.
If the subject comes across a situation
that confuses it, it attempts to return
to the caster for clarification. Like
Independence (p. 96), this spell does
not count as a spell “on,” and does not
require separate maintenance.

Example: Lady Ann Goulding has
created a magical servant to amuse
her noble and decadent guests. She
wishes it to circulate throughout the
party, serving food, dancing with the
noblewomen, and showing appropriate respect – without requiring constant supervision, so that she can
enjoy herself. It begins with 9 in every
attribute, but no skills (Lady Ann
could have created a skilled servitor,
but she has Create Servant-15 and can
maintain an unskilled one indefinitely). To this base she adds 2 points of
DX (bringing it up to her own DX of
11), and 2 points of IQ (well below her
own IQ of 14) to make it wittier. This
is a total attribute increase of 4, for a
base cost of 2.
Lady Ann then gives it two skills –
Dancing and Savoir-Faire. She has
Dancing-14 (DX+3), and since the servant has the same DX as she does, the
servant will, too. The lady’s knowledge
of Savoir-Faire is considerable (skill
15, or IQ+1), but the servant is not as
smart as she, and will only have it at
its own IQ+1, for a net Savoir-Faire13. These two skills add 2 more to the
base cost, for a total of 4. Since the
servant is less than 1 yard in radius, a
casting at base cost will suffice.
Duration: As long as the subject
lasts.
Base cost: 1/3 per point of DX or IQ
increase (round up), plus 1 per skill;
minimum base cost of 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Independence and
Wisdom.

Create Object (VH)
Regular
Create any sort of simple artifact
with which the caster is familiar – e.g.,
a robe, a sword, a cup. It cannot create
a magical item or a living creature.
Limitations: Food created this way
will seem nourishing, but in fact is not.
Information cannot be created; a book
could not be created unless the caster
knew all its contents by heart. A work
of art will be only as good as the caster
could make it by hand. A mechanical
device cannot be created unless the
caster could build it himself. (GMs –
the intent of this rule is to make it
almost impossible for mages to create
cars, transistor radios, etc. Be strict.)
Duration: The created object lasts
indefinitely – as long as it is touching
a living, thinking being. Thus, a wizard can create a sword, and use it himself or give it to a friend – but if he creates a coin to cheat a merchant, it will
vanish if the merchant drops it on the
counter or tosses it in the air! A created item does not actually have to
touch flesh, but it must be very close
to someone. It could be held in a
gloved hand, carried in a pocket, etc.,
but not stored in a backpack.
Cost: 2 for every 5 pounds the created item weighs.
Time to cast: Equal to cost, in seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Create
Earth, and Perfect Illusion.

Duplicate (VH)
Regular
Like Create Object, but instead of
creating an object from the caster’s
mind, the Duplicate spell duplicates
an actual item, which must be held or
touched by the caster while the spell is
cast. This permits a mage with no
knowledge of Armoury to create a gun
– if he has another one handy to copy.
It also permits perfect forgeries of
works of art, money, documents, and
so on. The magical duplicate follows
all normal rules for items made with
Create Object – it must remain in contact with a living thing, for instance, or
it will disappear.
The mage may also attempt to alter
the creation. For instance, he could
copy a sword and add inscribed runes,
or forge a passport with a different
name or picture, etc. In this case, normal rules for the caster’s abilities
apply; Forgery skill rolls may be
required. A mage with no knowledge
of guns could gold-plate a duplicate,
but he couldn’t modify the firing
mechanism or ammunition capacity.
Duration: As per Create Object
(above)
Cost: 3 for every 5 pounds that the
created object weighs.
Time to cast: Equal to the cost, in
seconds.
Prerequisites: Create Object and
Copy.

Item
a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:

650. (b) A duplicate may be made
permanent for 100 times casting cost.

Create Servant
Regular
Creates a stupid but obedient servitor (all attributes equal to 9) to do the
caster’s bidding. The caster determines the servant’s appearance. This
same spell can also create a Brute – a
servant with ST of 16, and all other
attributes at 9. Or it can create a servant with attributes at 9 and one noncombat non-IQ-based skill at level 16.
Any created servant follows simple
spoken commands, delivers verbal
messages, etc. It is under the GM’s
control. It cannot fight or handle confusing situations; it has no skills.
Faced with danger, it whimpers, flees,
or simply vanishes. If questioned, it
knows only who its master is and what
its orders are.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain. For a
skilled servitor, 4 to cast; 2 to
maintain. For a Brute, 6 to cast; 2 to
maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, IQ 12 or
higher, and Create Object.

Create Warrior
Regular
Creates a warrior to fight as the
caster commands. He has IQ 10; ST,
DX, and HT 12; and skill 16 with any
single weapon (or unarmed combat
ability) the caster desires. He has no
weapons or armor when created, but
uses what he is given.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 4 to maintain. Cost
to create a Brute Warrior (ST of 16) is
6 to cast; 6 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Create Servant.

Create Animal
Regular
Create an animal (IQ 5 or less) that
does your mental bidding while it
exists. A created living being continues
to exist until the caster stops maintaining the spell, or until it is killed, at
which point it vanishes.
A living creation must be identical
to a “real” living being with which the
caster is familiar. You cannot create an
imaginary being, or even a real creature of which you have only heard stories. Neither can you create a bear with
poison fangs . . . but some wizards
occasionally research private variations on the spell to make unusual
creatures.
Create Animal may also be used to
create a swarm of small creatures
(p. B461). A “swarm” costs 2 energy to
create.

Item
(a) A mage may create a permanent mount for 100 times the casting
cost. (b) Horn or whistle. Usable only
by mages. Sounding the horn or whistle causes the mount to appear as if
summoned. Energy cost to create: 200
times the casting cost for the intended
type of mount.

Cost: 1.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Create Animal or
Create Servant.

Item
Wand or staff; the item must touch
the subject creation. Energy cost to
create: 400.

Create Mount
Regular
Create a stupid but obedient
mount on which to ride while it exists.
It can also be used as a draft animal.
The mount’s traits are equivalent to
a pony (p. B460), but the caster sets its
appearance at casting time; it can be a
horse, camel, dolphin, dwarf elephant,
huge ostrich, or anything else the GM
agrees to (use the Create Animal
guidelines). The mount can only
understand very simple spoken commands, such as stop, go, left, right,
about face, etc. It is under the GM’s
control and cannot fight or handle
confusing situations; it has no skills.
Faced with danger, it will whimper,
bolt, or simply vanish.
The caster may also choose to create a Brute mount with ST 35, a
Winged mount with Move 7/14, a
Racing mount with Move 18, or a WarTrained mount that remains calm in
dangerous situations and can be
ordered to trample or attack.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 8 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Double the cost for a Brute mount, a
Winged mount, a War-Trained mount,
or a Racing mount. Triple the cost for
a Winged Racing mount, etc.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Create
Animal.

Control Creation
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Takes control of a living Creation
cast by someone else. On a success,
further energy costs are necessary to
maintain the creation. On a failure,
the creation remains the original caster’s. This spell cannot affect an
Illusion.
Cost: 1.
Time to cast: 2 seconds. Prerequisite: Create Animal or
Create Servant.


Dispel Creation
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Destroys any sort of Creation. Does
not affect illusions.
Cost: 1 to dispel a nonliving subject, or 3 to dispel a living creation.
Prerequisite: Control Creation.

Item
Wand or staff. Energy cost to
create: 500.



Measurement
Area; Information
Tells the caster any one of
the following things about
the subject: (a) its weight;
(b) its measurements in all
dimensions; (c) its area;
(d) its volume. This spell
will provide information in the native
system of the caster, be
that pounds, grams,
or stones about the
size of your head.
The measurement is
as precise as the caster can comprehend.
In some settings,
where other quantities are commonly
measured, other measurements may be
possible. At high TLs,
for example, the wavelength of a color may be
determined, or the frequency of a sound. The
speed of a moving object or
the local gravity are also quantities that could be measured
in some settings.
Base cost: 1.

Item
A different item exists for each of
the above functions: an enchanted
ruler for measurement, scales for
weight, a lens for color, or an onyx
cube for volume. The item must touch
the subject. Energy cost to create: 50.

Tell Time
Information
Tells the caster what time it is – as
well as the day and year, should that
be in doubt.
Cost: 1.

Item
Jewelry that lets the wearer know
the exact time whenever he wants.
Energy cost to create: 250.

Alarm
Regular
Alerts the subject at a specified
time in the future, awakening him if
necessary. It will also remind him of
one thing (in effect, delivering a message), provided he specified that thing
at the time the Alarm spell was cast.
Can be set to “go off” up to a week
from time of casting.
Duration: 1 week.
Cost: 1. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisite: Tell Time.

Item
Jewelry. It will buzz or vibrate at
exactly the same time every day, as set
by the original creator. Energy cost to
create: 60.

Far-Feeling
Regular
The subject can feel by touch any
object that he can see (even at a great
distance) or through solid objects
totaling no more than 6 feet in thickness. The sensations are one-way (to
pinch a wench, use the Manipulate
spell); in particular, a mage cannot
deliver spells by Far-Feeling!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Item
Gloves or jewelry. Affects only the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 200.


Small Vision
Regular
As listed under Light and Darkness
Spells, p. 111.

Find Direction
Information
Tells the caster which direction is
North. Alternately, it can tell which
way his home is. Note that no one can
have more than one true home, and a
wanderer may have none!
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Earth Vision
Regular
As listed under Earth Spells, p. 51.

Air Vision
As listed under Air Spells, p. 24.

Detect Magic
Regular
Determines whether any one object
is magical. If the spell is successful, a
second casting tells whether the magic
is temporary or permanent. A critical
success on either roll fully identifies
the spell, as for Analyze Magic.
This is not the same as the ability
to detect magic items that comes with
Magery 0; that ability only detects
permanent magic items, while Detect
Magic detects items, spells, magical
creatures, and any other ongoing
magical effect.
Cost: 2.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.


Tell Position
Information
Tells the caster the subject’s exact
distance, azimuth, and altitude relative to the caster. The caster must be
able to see the subject.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Measurement.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 150.


Test Load
Area; Information
Tells the caster how much weight
the subject can support before warping
or breaking. This can reveal the
capacity of bridges, baskets, ropes, etc.
Base cost: 1 (minimum 2).
Prerequisite: Measurement.

Sense Mana
Information
Tells the caster the mana level at
the point where he is standing, and
whether the local mana is aspected
(see GURPS Fantasy) or otherwise
unusual. If the spell is successful, a
second casting will reveal the precise
nature and level of any aspect or other
peculiarity.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Item
Regular

Aura
Information
Creates a glowing halo, or “aura,”
around the subject. This aura gives the
caster a general insight into the subject’s personality – the better the skill
roll, the better the insight. The aura
also shows whether the subject has
Magery, Magic Resistance, or Magic
Susceptibility (and what level);
whether the subject is possessed or
controlled in any way; and whether
the subject is in the grip of any violent
emotion. A critical success will detect
“secret” traits, such as lycanthropy,
vampirism, and unnatural longevity.
All living beings have auras; inanimate things do not. A zombie is
detectable by his faint, death-haunted
aura, while a vampire retains the aura
he had in life. Illusions and created
beings have no aura, so a successful
casting of this spell distinguishes them
from real persons.
Cost: 3 (for any size subject).
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 100.

Identify Spell
Information
Identifies what spell or spells have just been cast (within the last five sec- onds), or are being cast at the moment, on or by the subject. It does not identify the spells on a perma- nently enchanted item. One casting identifies all spells cast on or by the subject. However, if any of these spells are totally unknown to the caster – not just spells he doesn’t know, but spells he has never heard of – the GM should provide only a vague description; e.g., “Some kind of physical protection.” Wizards have heard of every spell in this book (unless the GM rules that some are secret) but not new spells created by the GM or players.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Mage Sense
Information
Detect all magical items in your field of vision. Each such item will have a glow or “aura,” similar to the aura of a living being. This glow is vis- ible through clothes, armor, or up to 1/2” of solid material.
The aura of a permanently enchant- ed item will be stronger than that of something under a temporary spell. Enchanted (or magical) beings also glow, though mages themselves do not unless they actually have spells on them at the moment. The aura may also give a clue to an item’s nature. On a good roll, for instance, fire spells will have a distinctive red glow, and evil items will somehow seem to have a “black glow” in their auras. A critical success with this spell lets the caster fully identify every magic item he sees. Note that this ability is essentially a more reliable ver- sion of the magical sense that comes with Magery 0 (p. B66).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Information

Identifies what spell or spells have
just been cast (within the last five seconds), or are being cast at the
moment, on or by the subject. It does
not identify the spells on a permanently enchanted item. One casting
identifies all spells cast on or by the
subject. However, if any of these spells
are totally unknown to the caster – not
just spells he doesn’t know, but spells
he has never heard of – the GM should
provide only a vague description; e.g.,
“Some kind of physical protection.”
Wizards have heard of every spell in
this book (unless the GM rules that
some are secret) but not new spells
created by the GM or players.

Tells the caster whether some
unseen magical item or creature is
nearby. The caster may specify that he
is looking for any unseen item, or he
may specify a certain object.

Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Skill modifier: the distance in yards
to the object sought. Use the closest
distance if the caster moves around
during the spell’s duration, and roll at
the end of that time. At the GM’s
option, some very powerful magic
items may be easier to sense.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 1,200.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 1,100.

Mage Sight
Regular
Detect all magical items in your
field of vision. Each such item will
have a glow or “aura,” similar to the
aura of a living being. This glow is visible through clothes, armor, or up to
1/2” of solid material.
The aura of a permanently enchanted item will be stronger than that of
something under a temporary spell.
Enchanted (or magical) beings also
glow, though mages themselves do not
unless they actually have spells on them
at the moment. The aura may also give
a clue to an item’s nature. On a good
roll, for instance, fire spells will have a
distinctive red glow, and evil items will
somehow seem to have a “black glow”
in their auras. A critical success with
this spell lets the caster fully identify
every magic item he sees. Note that this
ability is essentially a more reliable version of the magical sense that comes
with Magery 0 (p. B66).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 800.

Seek Magic
Information
Determines the direction and
approximate distance of the nearest
significant magical item, active spell,
or magical being (magical beings
include demons, elementals, spirits,
etc., but not races or individuals with
Magery). Regular range penalties
apply. Any known examples of magic
may be excluded if the caster specifically mentions them before casting.
This is also a Meta-Spell.
Cost: 6.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Detect Magic.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 1,200.

Analyze Magic
Information; Resisted by spells
that conceal magic
Identifies exactly what spells are on
the subject. If the subject has more than
one spell on it, Analyze Magic identifies
the one that took the least energy, and
tells the caster “there are more spells.”
It can then be cast again to determine
the next spell, and so on. Name and
Password enchantments (p. 68) count
as separate spells that resist at +5; any
individual wizard may only attempt to
Analyze a Name or Password once. Like
Identify Spell, above, it will give limited
results when the caster is faced with an
unknown spell.
Cost: 8.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisite: Identify Spell.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 1,200.

Summon Shade (VH)
Information; Resisted by Will
Summons a “shade” of the subject
from a possible future, to answer the
caster’s questions. The shade will not
lie (except on a critical failure) but it
will be disoriented; therefore its
answers may be unclear and imprecise. One question may be asked per
minute the spell is maintained. Since
the shade only comes from the most
likely future, this spell may be an
unsatisfactory augury.
Example: Felix Magister might summon a shade of his friend Rudolph
from two months ahead, and ask if his
attack on the dragon succeeded – and
then, if the answer was “no,” persuade
the real Rudolph not to try. The shade
simply came from a different future. Of
course, the shade might also reply “no –
it was called off.”
At the time from which the shade is
drawn, the subject will have a vivid
dream in which he will see his questioner(s) and remember all that is said
– if the predicted event came true.
Skill modifiers: -1 for each year in
the future that the shade is drawn; -5 if
the subject is not present or -10 if nothing pertaining to the subject (clothing,
hair clippings, etc.) is present. -10 if the
subjects full name is not known.
This spell may not be attempted
more than once per year on the same
person. This is a very powerful spell,
and GMs may wish to restrict access
to this spell, or require expensive
materials.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 50 to cast. 20 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 minutes. One try
per year.
Prerequisite: Summon Spirit or
Divination.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by a mage. The item does not give ability to cast the spell, but gives +2 skill to
one who knows the spell. Energy cost
to create: 800.

Glass Wall
Regular
See through a single wall, floor,
ceiling, or other similar barrier up to 4
feet thick (material doesn’t matter).
Duration: 1 minute.

Knowledge spells or Earth Vision.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost

Plant Vision
Regular
As listed under Plant Spells, p. 162.

Know Location
Information
Gives the caster a reasonable idea
of his geographical location (to within
a couple of miles). This will be
expressed in terms of the nearest
named features that the caster has
heard of (if in doubt as to whether or
not the caster has heard of the feature,
the GM should roll against the caster’s
Area Knowledge). For example, “You are in the Sahara Desert, roughly 30 miles north of Timbuktu.”
Cost: 2.
Time to cast: 10 seconds. On successive castings, the spell repeats its last answer (right or wrong) until the caster moves a mile or so from the location.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Tell Position.


Wizard Mouth
Regular
Creates a replica – about 4” across – of the caster’s physical mouth and lips, through which he can speak as well as taste. The Mouth flies through the air with a Move of 10, on the cast- er’s turn, though it may not do so with- out bumping into things unless accompanied by a Wizard Eye or Ear! Concentration is necessary to move the Mouth, but not to speak or taste through it. Any voice or taste-enhanc- ing spells affecting the caster will also be usable through the Mouth. The Mouth may not cast spells! While tast- ing through the Mouth, the wizard’s own mouth is insensitive. Every turn, he must specify whether he is tasting through the Mouth or through his own mouth.
The Mouth is small, with a SM of -6,soitishardtohit–butifitishitby a physical attack, or any spell that could reasonably incapacitate it, it is destroyed. The Mouth itself cannot inflict any biting damage.
This is also a Food spell and a Sound spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Apportation, Far-
Tasting, and Great Voice.


Wizard Eye
Regular
Creates a physical eye – a 2” ball –
through which the caster can see. The
Eye can fly through the air, vertically
and/or horizontally, with a Move of
10; it moves on the caster’s turn.
Concentration is necessary to move
the eye, but not to see through it. Any
vision-enhancing spells affecting the
caster will also be usable through the
Eye. The Eye is small, with a SM of -7,
so it is hard to hit – but if it is hit by a
physical attack, or any spell that
would reasonably incapacitate it, it is
destroyed.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Apportation and
Keen Vision.

Item
An eyeball carved of ivory and inset
with jewels. Usable only by mages. At
its holder’s command, it will turn into
a Wizard Eye; on returning to his
hand it will revert to the jeweled form.
Cost to create: 1,100 energy; $1,000 for
skilled ivory carving, and $600 for
emeralds.

Invisible Wizard Eye
Regular
Creates a Wizard Eye that cannot
be seen without the See Invisible
spell. Anyone who guesses where it is
may still attack, but the -7 penalty for
SM combined with the -6 penalty for
invisibility makes it very hard to hit.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisites: Wizard Eye and
Invisibility.

Item
As Wizard Eye, but more costly.
Cost to create: 1,600 energy; $1,000 for
skilled ivory carving, and $900 for
emeralds and opals.



Wizard Nose
Regular
Creates a disembodied replica –
about 2” to 3” long – of the caster’s
physical nose, through which he can
smell. The Nose flies through the air
with a Move of 10, on the caster’s turn,
though it may not do so without
bumping into things unless accompanied by a Wizard Ear or Eye!
Concentration is necessary to move
the Nose, but not to smell through it.
Any smell-enhancing spells affecting
the caster will also be usable through
the Nose. While smelling through the
Nose, the wizard’s own nose is insensitive. Every turn, he must specify
whether he is smelling through the
Nose or through his own nose.
The Nose is small, with a SM of -7,
but if it is hit by a physical attack or
any spell that could reasonably
incapacitate it, it is destroyed.
This is also a Food spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Apportation and FarTasting.

Item
(a) Any item depicting a human
nose may be turned into an immobile
Wizard Nose, through which the holder of a flower-shaped amulet, enchanted at the same time, may smell regardless of distance. Each such Nose links
to one amulet and vice versa. Energy
cost to create: 475. (b) A Nose carved of
precious stone. Usable only by mages.
At its holder’s command, it will turn
into a Wizard Nose; on returning to
his hand it will revert to the object
form. Cost to create: 500 energy and
$500 in materials and workmanship.

Wizard Hand
Regular
Creates a replica of the caster’s
physical hand, through which he can
grasp as well as feel. The hand flies
through the air with a Move of 10, on
the caster’s turn, though it may not do
so without bumping into things unless
accompanied by a Wizard Ear or Eye!
Alternatively, it may grope its way
along walls, floors, and ceilings at a
Move of 3. Concentration is necessary
to move the hand, but not to hold or
feel through it. The hand may not cast
or deliver spells! Any touch-enhancing
spells affecting the caster will also be
usable through the hand. While feeling through the hand, the wizard’s
own hands are insensitive. Every turn,
he must specify whether he is feeling
through the Hand or through his own
hands.
The Hand is small, with a SM of -5,
but any hit with a physical attack or
any spell that could reasonably incapacitate it will destroy it. The Hand
itself cannot inflict any punching
damage; it has ST 2 and the caster’s
DX.
This is also a Movement spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast and 3 to maintain for
one Hand; 6 to cast and 4 to maintain
for two Hands.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Manipulate and FarFeeling.

Item
(a) Any item depicting a human
hand may be turned into a stationary
Wizard Hand, through which the
wearer of a glove, enchanted at the
same time, may feel regardless of distance. Each such hand links to one
glove and vice versa. Energy cost to create: 300. (b) A hand carved of precious
wood. Usable only by mages. At its
holder’s command, it will turn into a
Wizard Hand; on returning to his
hand it will revert to the object form.
Cost to create: 400 energy and $500 in
materials and workmanship.

Memorize
Regular
All that the caster perceives at the
time of casting (and for 10 seconds
thereafter) is implanted perfectly in his
memory, as if he had Photographic
Memory (p. B51). The spell can be used
to memorize maps, faces, an event, etc.
It cannot be used to learn a skill or to
retain a magically borrowed one.
This is also a Mind Control spell.
Duration: 1 day. After that, check
IQ every day, at a cumulative -1 per
day. On a critical success, the memory
becomes permanent; on an ordinary
success, the memory is still there. On
an ordinary failure, the memory fades
to the level that the caster would normally have of the event; on a critical
failure, a false memory is created (still
susceptible to eventual fading).
Cost: 3 to cast. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Wisdom or at least six
Knowledge spells.

Item
(a) Jewelry or headgear. Energy cost
to create: 1,000. (b) Any. Always on; the
wearer can recall one thing specified by
the creator. The memory fades completely one hour after the item is
removed. Energy cost to create: 400. (c)
A memory can be made permanent for
an energy cost of 50, but it must remain
intact while the enchantment occurs.


Pathfinder
Information
Tells the caster the direction to a certain place, or the proper way to go to
get to that place – his choice. Use longdistance modifiers (p. 14). The GM
should apply penalties if the caster has
never been to the place, and severe
penalties if the caster isn’t sure that the
place really exists or what it is like. This
spell does not find people or things. A
city, mountain pass, or public building
can be a place. A certain person’s home
or office isn’t a “place” for this spell
unless the caster has been there.
Cost: 4. One try per day.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.



Astral Vision (VH)
Regular
See insubstantial
entities.
Examples include ghosts and subjects
of Ethereal Body, Projection, or Astral
Trip spells.
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Sense Spirit and See
Invisible.

Item
(a) Wand or staff. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 900. (b)


Projection
Regular
The caster briefly projects his mind
away from his body, to any spot within line of sight (use long-distance
modifiers, p. 14), to peruse his surroundings from a different viewpoint.
His projected self is totally insubstantial and can only see, hear, feel, smell,
and taste. Its presence can be detected
by Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense
Observation, or the like; it is otherwise
imperceptible.
The Projection cannot cross an
Astral Block, Pentagram, or an Utter
spell. Repel Spirits will resist its
intrusion.
The Projection cannot move; it can
only turn to look in different directions. The body is catatonic for the
duration of the spell; it cannot act. If
someone attacks the body, the spell is
broken automatically.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Sense Spirit and at
least four Knowledge spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 500.

Seeker
Information
Attunes the caster to one individual
or manmade object he is looking for. A
success gives the caster a vision of the
item’s whereabouts – or leads him to
it, if it is within a mile.
To seek a person, the caster must
either know his name or know him
well enough to visualize him. For
instance, you cannot use this spell to
solve a murder by seeking “the murderer” if you don’t know who that is –
but if you do, Seeker will find him.
Modifiers: Long-distance modifiers
(p. 14). Something associated with the
item sought (e.g., part of a lost person’s
clothing) should be available at the time
of casting; if not, roll at -5. The roll is at
+1 if the caster has held or is otherwise
familiar with the item sought.
Cost: 3. One try per week.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, IQ 12 or
higher, and at least two “Seek” spells.

Item
A forked stick (wood, bone, or
ivory) or compass needle (carved out
of ivory) that will always point to one
particular subject, chosen when the
item is created. Something pertaining
to the subject must be used in making
the item, and incorporated into it.
Energy cost to create: 500.

Trace
Regular
May be cast on any object or living
being. As long as the spell is maintained, the caster will know where the
subject is if he concentrates for a second. Either the subject must be with
the caster when the spell is first cast,
or the caster must first cast Seeker
successfully.
Long-distance modifiers (p. 14)
apply if the subject is not in the
caster’s presence.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain. One
try per day.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Seeker.

History
Information
When cast on any inanimate object
(or a 1-yard-radius section of a large
object), History lets the caster determine the recent past of that object,
user’s personality, and so on – but no
names!
Cost: 3 for one
day’s history; 5
for a week; 8 for
a month; 10 for a
year.
Time to cast:
1 second for
each energy point
spent.
Prerequisite: Trace.

Ancient History
Information
As History, but gives a general
impression of an item’s history over a
much greater time.
Cost: 3 for one year’s history; 5 for
10 years’ history; 8 for 100 years; 10
for 1,000 years.
Time to cast: 1 minute for each
energy point spent.
Prerequisite: History.

Prehistory
Information
This spell is similar to Ancient
History, but it gives even less specific
information over a period of millennia.
The age and function of an item can
always be determined, but unless the
item took part in an important event,
age and function may be the only information available. Fortunately, that’s
often enough for the archaeological
scholars who most often use Prehistory.
Cost: 3 for 1,000 years’ history; 5
for 10,000 years; 8 for 100,000 years;
10 for longer periods.
Time to cast: 1 hour for each energy point spent.
Prerequisite: Ancient History.

Reconstruct Spell
Information
Tells the caster what spells were
cast on, at, or by the subject at a specific point in the past selected by the
caster. If there were multiple spells on
the subject at the selected point,
Reconstruct Spell will identify the spell
that cost the least energy and tell the
caster “there are more spells.” The
Time modifiers (p. 81) apply. Spells are
identified as per Identify Spell (p. 102).
Cost: 3. The magnitude of the Time
modifier is added to the cost, so the
spell costs 3 (3 + 0) for “within a
minute,” but would cost 8 (3 + 5) for
“4 to 40 days.”
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, History,
and Identify Spell.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,400.

Know True Shape
Information
Tells if the subject is under any
kind of Shapeshifting spell or similar
magical effect, including Alter Visage,
Alter Body, and illusions. The caster
must be able to see the subject. The
spell also gives a general idea of the
subject’s true shape; on a critical success, it identifies the subject’s true
nature (including a common name or
description) and the magic used to
disguise it. It does not reveal the
nature of Hallucinations.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, any one
shifting spell (Shapeshifting, Alter
Visage or Body, Plant Form, Shrink,
etc.), and either Aura or Know Illusion.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry (a favorite is
a medallion or coin with an “Aperture
of True Vision” in it). Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 250.

Recall
Regular
The subject recalls a single forgotten or obscured fact or event as if he
had Photographic Memory (p. B51).
The penalties given under Time modifiers (p. 81) apply, based on the time
since the forgotten event occurred.
Eidetic Memory gives a +5 bonus;
Photographic Memory gives a +10
bonus (though individuals with
Photographic Memory will only need
this spell to restore unnaturally
removed memories). Only a critical
success allows a magically blocked
memory to be recalled. A critical failure could cause a false or distorted
memory, or eradicate the memory
beyond hope of future recovery!
This is also a Mind Control spell.
Duration: 1 day. Afterwards, the
memory fades as per the Memorize
spell.
Cost: 4. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Memorize,
and History.

Item
(a) Headgear, wand, or jewelry.
Usable only by a mage. Energy cost to
create: 2,500. (b) A memory can be
made permanent for an energy cost of
50, but the memory must remain
intact while the enchantment occurs.

See Secrets
Regular
Causes hidden items, doors, traps,
etc., to stand out clearly in the subject’s
vision. This spell works only on things
that were deliberately hidden – not lost.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Seeker and Aura.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. The item
must be carved with a picture of an
eye. Energy cost to create: 400.

Remember Path
Regular
While this spell is active, its subject
will perfectly remember any path he
treads on. The memory would allow
the subject to draw an accurate map of
his travels or to retrace his steps without error, even in pitch darkness or
through distractions such as combat.
Of course, later alterations of previously traveled terrain will be unknown
to the subject (a mine cave-in after the
subject has left it, for example).
Duration: 1 hour. Once the spell
lapses, the memory begins to fade as
per the Memorize spell, with IQ checks
being made hourly, not daily. Once
recalled, a memory can be made permanent for an energy cost of 50 (via
enchantment), but the memory must
remain intact while the enchantment
occurs.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Find Direction and
Memorize.

Item
(a) Jewelry or staff. Energy cost to
create: 600. (b) A forked stick or compass needle that will point the way
along one path specified by the creator.
If activated from off the path, it will
point to the nearest point along the
path. An alternate form of this item is
a small magical ball that will roll along
the path just ahead of the traveler, at


Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 700.

Scents of the Past
Regular
When cast on a wall or some
object, this spell releases whatever
scents it may have been exposed to in
the past. The caster specifies the
moment from which to start the “playback.” The Time modifiers (p. 81)
apply. Each time this spell is cast for
the same time period, there is a further -1 penalty to skill. A critical failure wipes away the object’s “memory”
of that time period.
This is also a Food spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to cast. Same cost to maintain. The magnitude of the Time modifier is added to the cost, so the spell
costs 1 (1 + 0) for “within a minute,” but
would cost 6 (1 + 5) for “4 to 40 days.”
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, History,
and Odor.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 350.

Echoes of the Past
Regular
When cast on a wall, floor or some
object, this spell “plays back” whatever sounds it may have “heard” in the
past. The caster specifies the moment
from which to start listening (“Let us
listen to what was said in this room a
year ago . . .”). Time modifiers (p. 81)
apply. Each time this spell is cast for
the same time period, there is a further -1 penalty to skill. A critical failure will wipe away the object’s
“memory” of that time period.
This is also a Sound spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain. The
magnitude of the Time modifier is
added to the cost, so the spell costs 2
(2 + 0) for “within a minute,” but
would cost 7 (2 + 5) for “4 to 40 days.”
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, History,
and Voices.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 500.

Images of the Past
Regular
When cast on a mirror or reflective
surface, this spell “plays back”
whatever images it may have “seen” in
the past. The caster specifies the
moment from which to start viewing
(“Let us see what happened in this
room a year ago . . . ”). The Time modifiers (p. 81) apply. Each time this spell
is cast for the same time period, there
is a further -1 penalty to skill. A critical failure will wipe away the object’s
“memory” of that time period.
GMs may also allow the spell to be
cast on any floor, wall or object, the
“playback” manifesting itself as a
Simple Illusion.
This is also a Light and Darkness
spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain. The
magnitude of the Time modifier is
added to the cost, so the spell costs 3
(3 + 0) for “within a minute,” but
would cost 8 (3 + 5) for “4 to 40 days.”
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, History,
and Simple Illusion.

Divination
Information
Gives the caster a vision relevant to
his question, or the answer to one yesor-no question. There are many sorts
of divination; each is a separate spell,
and requires the appropriate materials
(see below). Each has its own
strengths and weaknesses. Those
methods that are linked to a particular
element or elements will give more
detailed answers if the answer has
something to do with that element –
e.g., lecanomancy would work better
than extispicy for a question about the
sea.
Skill modifiers: Standard long-distance modifiers (p. 14). If repeated
questions are asked on the same subject within a day, the “vibes” are muddled; -4 skill for the second question,
-8 for the third, and so on. Questions
about the past or future are also
harder; use the Time modifiers (p. 81).
Cost: 10.
Time to cast: 1 hour unless specified otherwise.
Prerequisites: History, and other
spells as specified for the particular
method of divination.



Continual Light
Regular
When cast on a small object (up to
fist-sized or 1 pound) or a small part
of a larger object, makes that object
glow with white light.

Item
Any item can be made to
glow permanently, for 100
times the above energy cost
(e.g., 200 for a dim glow, etc.).

light. The spell must be cast
on the source of the light. If

with the same spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain
(but the change is permanent on a
Continual Light spell).
Prerequisite: Light.

Item
Jewelry. Always on; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 100; must
include a $100 black onyx.

Shape Light
Regular
With this spell, the caster may
transform a uniform light source into
a directional one. The caster may specify any number of “baffles” or restrict
the illumination to specific beams.
Thus, the spell can change a torch
into a hooded lantern of sorts.
Concentration is required to change
the light’s shape, but not to maintain it.
The spell can also be used to bend
and twist light beams. The GM should
allow any effect that isn’t already covered by such spells as Simple Illusion,
Small Vision, Invisibility, and so on.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Light.

Item
(a) The effects may be made permanent for 100 times casting cost (creating a permanent light-sculpture),

light (like a roaring fire or the sun)
and protect against blinding from the

similar occurrences.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Keen Vision or at
least five Light and Darkness spells.

Infravision
Regular
See “infrared” or heat rays in addition to normal light, as with the

Infravision advantage (p. B60). This
spell does not let invisible objects be
seen.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Keen Vision or 5 Light
spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry; affects only
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 100.

Night Vision
Regular
See clearly as long as there is any
light at all, as with Night Vision 9. In
utter darkness, the subject is still blind.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Keen Vision or 5 Light
spells.

Small Vision
Regular
The subject can examine objects
within his reach as if they were under
x100 magnification, as per Microscopic
Vision 2 (p. B68). While the spell is on,
the subject is extremely nearsighted
(see Bad Sight. p. B123): he is incapable
of seeing objects further than a yard
away clearly – they appear blurred and
all melee attacks are made at -2 to skill.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Each
doubling of casting cost increases the
magnification ten-fold.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Keen Vision or at
least five Light and Darkness spells.
Subject must not suffer from
Blindness or Bad Sight.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry; affects only
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 200.

Hawk Vision
Regular
Grants the subject extraordinary
clarity of vision and the ability to
“zoom in” on distant objects, providing the equivalent of Telescopic Vision
(p. B92). Each level lets the subject
ignore -1 in range penalties to Vision
rolls at all times, or -2 in range penalties if you take an Aim maneuver to
zoom in on a particular target. This
ability can also function as a telescopic sight, giving up to +1 Accuracy per
level with ranged attacks provided you
take an Aim maneuver for seconds
equal to the bonus. These benefits of
this spell are not cumulative with
those of technological aids such as
binoculars or scopes. If you use both,
you must opt for one or the other.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 per level of Telescopic
Vision. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Keen Vision or 5
Light spells. Subject must not suffer
from Blindness or Bad Sight disadvantages.

Item
Clothing or jewelry, including a
picture of a hawk. Affects only the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 400.

(a) Clothing or jewelry. The item
must bear a life-size picture of a flea.
Only affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 400. (b) A gem that works as a
magnifying glass. Cost to create: 400
energy, plus the cost of the gem.

Dark Vision
Regular
The subject can see even in pitch
darkness, as if he had the Dark Vision
advantage. He can also ignore the
effects of the Darkness spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Night Vision
Infravision.

Darkness
Area
Cloaks the area of effect in pitch
darkness. A person inside the area can
see out normally, but can see nothing
else within the area. Those outside the
area can see only darkness within.
Thus, attacks out of darkness suffer no
penalty, but attacks into darkness are
at a penalty; see p. B394 for combat
rules.
The Dark Vision advantage lets you
see through a Darkness spell, but
Night Vision and Infravision do not.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Continual Light.

Item
Floor, ground, or a rug can be
enchanted so that the area above
(about 6 feet) is in permanent darkness. Energy cost to create: 12 per
square foot.

Blackout
Area
Shrouds the affected area in
impenetrable blackness. No one can
see into the affected area, and no one
within the affected area can see anything; see p. B394 for combat rules.
The Dark Vision advantage lets you
see through a Blackout spell, but
Night Vision and Infravision do not.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Darkness.

Item
Floor, ground, or a rug can be
enchanted so that the area above
(about 6 feet) is in permanent blackout. Energy cost to create: 15 per
square foot.

Glow
Area
Suffuses an area with a uniform glow. Objects and beings standing in the area won’t project any shadows unless a source of light stronger than the ambient glow is brought in.
Duration: Variable. The GM should roll 2d for the number of days.
Base cost: 1/2 for starlight; 1 for moonlight; 3/2 for torchlight; 2 for daylight
(bright, no Vision penalty). Minimum
radius is 2 yards.
Time to cast: 1 second per halfpoint of base cost
Prerequisite: Continual Light.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 250. (b) An area can be
permanently illuminated for 100
times casting cost.

Gloom
Area
Plunges an area into gloom. The
more energy is put into the base cost,
the gloomier the ambient light
becomes. Unlike the Darkness spell,
sources of light still work normally
within the area.
Duration: Variable. The GM should
roll 2d for the number of days.
Base cost: 1/2 for torchlight; 1 for
moonlight; 3/2 for starlight; 2 for total
darkness. Minimum radius is 2 yards.
Time to cast: 1 second per halfpoint of base cost.
Prerequisite: Continual Light.

Item

Light Jet
Regular
Emit a beam of bright light from
one finger. This beam can be used like a
flashlight. It gives good illumination for
10 yards in the direction it is pointed, and some vision will be possible up to 30 yards away. It can be used as a signal for up to a mile if visibility is good.
Can be used in combat to blind foes within 10 yards, but only in relative darkness (e.g., when the combat penal- ty is at least -5). Each turn, the caster rolls against Innate Attack skill or DX- 4, with a -5 penalty to hit the face. This attack can be dodged or blocked, but not parried. If the target is hit, he will be at a -4 penalty to combat skills on his next turn, and at a -1 penalty for the remainder of the combat. This effect is not cumulative. Foes with Night Vision double these penalties.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain. Prerequisite: Continual Light or
Shape Light.

Flash
Regular
Creates a brilliant flash of light. This will totally blind some that see it, and
reduce the DX of others by 3 (which reduces all DX-based skills). It may affect
anyone who is facing the flash and has his eyes open (GM’s decision, if miniatures
are not being used). The caster himself is not affected if he closes his eyes as he
casts the spell. Each other creature in range must make a HT roll to avoid the
worst effects:
Distance         If HT roll is made        If HT roll is not made
Within 10 yards  1 minute at -3 DX         3 sec. blind, 1 min. at -3 DX
11 to 25 yards   10 sec. at -3 DX          1 minute at -3 DX
26 or more yards no effect                 3 seconds at -3 DX
Cost: 4.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Continual Light.

Item
Glove or ring; the item lets the
wearer cast the spell. Energy cost to
create: 200.

Mirror
Regular
Creates a reflective surface. It can
be cast on an object or can be freestanding (in which case it is twosided). The mirror surface is not necessarily flat; the caster could create
fun-house mirrors, for example.
In a scientific-paradigm universe,
casters with knowledge of physics can
use this spell to create parabolic
reflectors. A simple curve can be sufficient to cook meat; a large and precise
one could be used to melt lead, given
sufficient sunlight at appropriate
angles. Against living targets, the GM
can assume that such a mirror would
do 1 point of burning damage per yard
radius of mirror every 10 seconds. To
ignite things, use the Ignite Fire guidelines (p. 72), substituting the Mirror
size for the listed energy cost. An 8yard-radius Mirror ignites heavy wood
in about 10 seconds. Other, similar
uses are subject to GM approval.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Colors.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 350; the item must include a
tiny mirror.

Remove Reflection
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject’s reflection(s) seem to
disappear from mirrors, pools, etc. At
higher TLs, this may make the subject
invisible to sensors that use mirrors as
part of their optical pathways, at the
GM’s discretion.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Remove Shadow.

Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Darkness or Gloom.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry; only affects
the wearer/holder. Energy cost to
create: 100 per point of penalty.

Shape Darkness
Area
Shape and move three-dimension- al darkness created with the Darkness or Blackout spells at a Move of 5. It also allows the caster to shape existing two-dimensional shadows into other two-dimensional shadowy shapes. Shadows can be reduced in size easily, but enlarging the shadows makes them slightly transparent. The average casual observer won’t notice, but any- one looking intently at the shadow gets an IQ roll to notice that it doesn’t have the “substance” it should. Shadows do not have to remain attached to the objects that cast them.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2. Same cost to main- tain. For two-dimensional shadows, the base cost is 1.
Prerequisite: Darkness.

Item
Jewelry. Always on. Only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 200; must
include a $100 black onyx.

Wall of Light
Area
Creates a curtain of light around an
area. The wall is four yards high, but
may be made higher; simply scale the
cost as the height (double for 8 yards
high, triple for 12 yards high and so on).
The only thing it blocks is vision,
both ways. It has no effect on spells,
beings, sounds, etc. Bright Vision
allows one to see through the wall.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1 to 3 to cast. Same cost
to maintain. The Wall’s glow depends
on the energy put into its base cost, as
per Continual Light.
Prerequisite: Continual Light.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 200. (b) A Wall of Light
may be made permanent at an energy
cost of 100 times normal.

Blur
Regular
Makes the subject harder to see
and therefore harder to hit with
attacks. Each point of energy gives -1
to the effective skill of any attack on
the subject, to a maximum of -5.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 5 to cast. Same cost to
maintain.

See Invisible
Regular
Subject can see anything concealed
by the Invisibility spell or by “natural”
invisibility. These things will be slightly translucent; thus, you can see
through them and tell that they appear
invisible to others.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Either Dark Vision
and Infravision or Invisibility.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry; only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 400.

Mage Light
Regular
Creates a small light. However, the
illumination that it provides is only
perceptible to mages, magical creatures, and those under the influence of
Mage Sight. It moves just like Light
does. An IQ+Magery roll is not required
to see or use the light provided.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 for a dim glow like candlelight, 2 for the brightness of a torch, 3
for a glare as bright as day. Same cost
to maintain.
Prerequisites: Mage Sight and
Light.

Item

Hide
Regular
Makes the subject harder to find. A
Vision roll is necessary to see a subject
in plain sight; Sense rolls to detect a
subject already hidden are at -1 per
point of energy spent, to a maximum
of -5. These effects only apply while
the subject remains still, but if he
moves and then stops moving before
the spell expires, the effects resume.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 to 5 to cast. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Blur or Forgetfulness.

Item
(a) Jewelry, wand, or staff; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b) Any item can be
enchanted to make it permanently
“hidden,” at an energy cost of 200 per
point of “hiddenness.”

Wand, staff, jewelry, or lantern.
Usable only by mages. Energy cost to
create: 100.

Continual Mage Light
Regular
When cast on a small object (up to
fist-sized, or 1 pound), or a small part of
a large object, this spell makes that
object glow with Mage Light
Duration: Variable. The GM should
roll 2d for the number of days.
Cost: 2 for a dim glow like candlelight, 4 for the brightness of a torch, 6
for a glare as bright as day. Same cost
to maintain.
Prerequisites: Mage Light and
Continual Light.

Item
Any item may be made to radiate
mage light permanently, for 100 times
the above energy cost (e.g., 200 for a
dim glow, etc.)

Sunlight
Area
The area is illuminated in full daylight – even underground! The area
extends skyward, stopping only when
it hits some sort of ceiling. If cast in a
cave, the area is a huge shaft of light
extending upward to the rock. If cast
on a cloudy day outdoors, the light
appears to break through the clouds
above. If cast at night, the light
appears to come from an overhead
star which brightens to sun level for
those inside the area.
Treat the light as natural sunlight
for all purposes – it can be used to
grow plants, get a tan, etc. Creatures
who are susceptible to the effects of
sunlight (such as vampires) are fully
affected.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Glow, and
Colors.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 150.

Continual Sunlight
Area
Illuminates an area as per the
Sunlight spell, but lasts longer and
cannot be maintained.
Duration: Variable. Roll 2d for
number of days.
Base cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Sunlight.

Item
The area may be permanently illuminated for 100 times the cost to cast
the spell.

Invisibility
Regular
The subject cannot be seen and
does not appear in reflections or photographs. He still makes sounds and
can be tracked by scent or footprints.
Anything he picks up becomes invisible, unless he wills it to stay visible.
Infravision cannot detect him, but See
Invisible can. Invisible characters
have a great advantage in combat: see
p. B394.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Six Light spells,
including Blur.

Item
(a) Jewelry, wand, or staff; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 1,200. (b) An item can be made
permanently invisible at an energy
cost of 500 per hex of size or 50
pounds of weight, whichever is
greater.

Body of Shadow (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
The subject’s body fades away, leaving only his shadow. The subject is
now a two-dimensional shadow on the
wall or floor, gaining the Shadow
Form advantage (p. B83) for the duration of the spell. His clothing (up to 6
pounds) also becomes shadow, but
while in shadow form it loses any
magic powers it might have had. The
rest of his equipment tumbles to the
ground; he can carry nothing while in
this form.
Note that this spell does not augment the subject’s senses to allow him
to see in pitch darkness!
Duration: 1 minute. The spell
expires if the subject loses consciousness.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Shape
Darkness, and at least three
Movement spells.

Staff, wand, jewelry, or cape. Only
affects the wearer. A severe drawback
of each of these items except the cape
is that it falls through the subject as
soon as the spell is cast! Energy cost to
create: 2,500 (6,000 for the cape).

Cost: Any amount up to your
Magery level per second, for three seconds. The bolt does 1d-1 impaling
damage per energy point.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: At least six other
Light and Darkness spells, including
Sunlight.

Sunbolt
Missile
Shoot a bolt of concentrated sunlight from one fingertip. It has 1/2D
75, Max 150, Acc 2; use the Innate
Attack skill. The light burns like laser
light and does burning damage.
Increase a shield’s DB against this
spell by 50%, rounding down, if it is
highly polished.
Whether or not damage gets
through armor, a hit to the face blinds
the victim unless he makes a HT roll.
A hit to the eyes does double damage
and blinds the victim unless he makes
a HT roll at a penalty equal to the
damage suffered. Treat Sunboltinduced blindness as a crippling
injury for recovery purposes (p. B420).
Any mirror will reflect a Sunbolt; if
the GM is uncertain of the exact angle
of incidence/reflection (if the Sunbolt
hits a hand-held mirror, for instance),
determine its new direction randomly.
Use the rules for hitting the wrong target (p. B389) to determine if anything
along the new path is hit.
Deliberately reflected shots are a
much trickier matter; range penalties
will be for the total range to the target, with an additional -2 for each
“bounce.” And unless the mirrors are
very large and/or stable and/or deliberately placed for the purpose, the
GM may simply declare the shot
impossible.
Defending characters holding mirrors may attempt to reflect the bolt
back at the caster – treat this as a
Block defense at a -2 penalty; also
apply the normal range penalties from
the defender to the caster. The DB of
the mirror (if it is large enough to offer
any; GM call) adds to this roll normally. The caster may defend normally,
unless totally surprised.
Sunbolt is not affected by Missile
Shield or Reverse Missiles. Force
Dome and Deflect Energy do offer
protection. Areas of magical Darkness
or Blackout resist Sunbolt.

Item

Staff or wand; the bolt is fired from
the tip of the item. Usable only by
mages. Cost to create: 800 energy and
a sunstone worth at least $1,000.


Inspired Creation (VH)
Regular
Helps a subject create one craft
work – a weapon, suit of armor, painting, etc. – of a quality far beyond his
usual ability. The process is grueling,
costing the subject 5 HP and 10 FP.
The work is as good as if it were made
with a critical success by an artisan of
skill 5 levels higher than the subject’s
actual skill; no roll is required. A

weapon created under the effects of
this spell is automatically of very fine
quality. Such items are not technically
magic items, but can be (and often
are) enchanted further.
At the GM’s option, this spell may be
used on works of art other than crafts –
books, performances, songs, etc.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 5 per day spent creating the
object.
Time to cast: The usual time to
make the object.

Awaken Craft Spirit
Regular
Every well-crafted object, whether
a tool, a weapon, or a work of art, may
contain a spirit slumbering within it.
This spell allows the caster to awaken
the spirit of any item created by an
artisan with a margin of success by 5
or more (the GM can assume this was
the case for an artisan with skill of at
least 15, or for any fine or very fine
item). Any item created with Inspired
Creation has a craft spirit. The spirit
can answer one question per minute
regarding its maker or any of its owners. The spirit remains awake for the
duration of the spell; it may remain
awake or return to sleep when the
spell expires, according to its own
whim.
Not every setting has craft spirits; if
the GM does not feel that they are
appropriate to the setting, this spell
does not exist.
This is also a Necromantic spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Inspired Creation
and Sense Spirit.

Find Weakness
Information
Sense the weakest part of the subject. Can be cast on any part of a large
object; you would not have to cast it
on a whole city wall, for instance, but
could check one yard of wall at a time.
Of course, many subjects will have no
special weakness.
This spell can be used to troubleshoot complex objects; a defect
that prevents a machine from working
usually qualifies as its weakest part.
Cost: 1, or 1 per yard radius for a large object. Double this cost if the subject is alive.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: One spell from each of the four elements.

Clean
Area
Cleans the subject area or being
(i.e., removes dirt and stains, and
polishes surfaces which can hold a
polish). Does not remove lingering
odors (use Purify Air for that).

Cost: 1, or 1 per yard radius for a
large object. Double this cost if the
subject is alive.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: One spell from each
of the four elements.

Item
Jewelry. Energy cost to create: 100.

Weaken
Regular
Does 1d damage to the weakest
part of the subject (works only on
inanimate items) for every two points
of energy put into the spell. See
p. B557, for DR and HP of various
items. No caster may use this spell on
the same subject more than once per
hour. Subject’s DR does not protect it.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2 to 6.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Find Weakness.

Item
Wand, staff, or glove. The item
must be used to strike the subject.
Energy cost to create: 200.

Restore
Regular
Temporarily makes a broken inanimate object look as good as new.
Other senses will not be fooled, nor
will Mage Sight.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Find Weakness or
Simple Illusion.

Weaken
Regular
Does 1d damage to the weakest part of the subject (works only on inanimate items) for every two points of energy put into the spell. See p. B557, for DR and HP of various items. No caster may use this spell on the same subject more than once per hour. Subject’s DR does not protect it.
Duration: Permanent.
Base cost: 2.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Restore.


Copy
Regular
Makes one or more copies of a sin- gle page of writing. Paper or parch- ment must be supplied for the copies to be made on. Copies of magical scrolls, rune parchments, and so on do not have magic power.
At higher TLs, this spell may be used on digital media; a single casting of this spell will copy about one kilobyte of information.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2 plus 1 for each copy made. The document copied may be 10 times longer if the caster doubles the energy cost; thus, 4 energy would produce one copy of a ten-page document, while 8 energy would copy a 100-page book.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Dye and at least Accented written proficiency in some language.

Item
Staff, wand, or cleaning instrument (broom, feather duster, etc.). The
item must touch the affected area.
Energy cost to create: 100.

Soilproof
Regular
The subject (person, creature, or
object) and anything he carries
become soilproof. Clothes neither
stain nor become dusty, hands won’t
collect grime, and so on. The spell
doesn’t affect stains already on the
subject at the time of casting.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Clean.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 400. (b) For 100 times
casting cost, any item may be permanently soilproofed. The item can be
made to also resist Ruin (with the
Endurance of the enchantment) at
double cost. On an ordinary failure,
the enchantment loses one point of
Endurance. Upon dropping to
Endurance 0, the enchantment ceases
to function. A critical failure by the
Soilproof or a critical success by the
Ruin also breaks the enchantment.

Dye
Regular
Changes the color of any unliving
material, as desired by the caster (note
that hair is unliving, as is a thin outer
layer of skin!). The color fades in 2d
days, but is unaffected by ordinary
washing or application of solvents.
Only a single, uniform, color can be
produced – patterns are not possible,
but only part of the subject may be
affected if the caster desires.
Duration: 2d days.
Cost: 1 for a small (up to palm- sized) object, 2 to change a person’s hair color or an object about a square foot in size, 5 for a person-sized (SM 0) object.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Restore and Colors.

Rejoin
Regular
Temporarily fixes a broken inanimate object. If some small parts are
missing, skill is at -3, but if the spell
succeeds the object holds together
without the missing parts.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 1 per 10 pound of subject’s
weight (minimum 2) to cast. Half that
(rounded up) to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds per 10
pounds of subject’s weight.
Prerequisites: Weaken and Restore.

Shatter (VH)
Regular
Similar to Weaken, but quicker – it
can be cast in a single second, and may
be cast repeatedly. If the spell does not
do enough damage to actually break
the subject, the subject takes no harm.

This spell only affects inanimate
objects.
Cost: 1 to 3; does 1d damage for
each point of energy put into it.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and
Weaken.

Item

Animate Object (VH)
Regular; Special Resistance
Animates an existing object (statue, sword, chair . . .). Its abilities and attributes depend on its body – this is entirely up to the GM.
Examples: a chair could move about and kick people in the shins or a sword could snake around its wield- er’s arm, but a teapot could do little more than scuttle amusingly across a table . . .
Concentration is required; the ani- mated object has no IQ score and is little more than a puppet. Independence and Initiative will not work on an animated object.
A being holding such an object resists with Will.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to cast for every 5 pounds the object weighs. Double cost to ani- mate stone, triple for metal. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least three “Shape” spells.



Stiffen
Regular; Special Resistance
Temporarily stiffens a limp object; turns a rope into a pole, for example, or a thread into a lockpick. Does not work on living beings. This spell can be used to make improvised weapons; the GM judges their effectiveness.
This spell may also be used to stiff- en a foe’s clothes. In this case, the foe resists the spell with his ST+2. If it works, he is at -1 DX for each pound of clothing that was stiffened, and this DX change does affect his Move.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 1 per pound of subject’s weight – minimum 2. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds per pound of weight.
Prerequisite: Rejoin.

Animate Object (VH)
Regular; Special Resistance
Animates an existing object (statue,
sword, chair . . .). Its abilities and
attributes depend on its body – this is
entirely up to the GM.
Examples: a chair could move
about and kick people in the shins or
a sword could snake around its wielder’s arm, but a teapot could do little
more than scuttle amusingly across a
table . . .
Concentration is required; the animated object has no IQ score and is
little more than a puppet.
Independence and Initiative will not
work on an animated object.
A being holding such an object resists with Will.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to cast for every 5 pounds the object weighs. Double cost to ani- mate stone, triple for metal. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least three “Shape” spells.

Item


Knot
Regular
Ties a knot that cannot be untied without magic (though the rope can be cut, of course). The knot unties when someone says the password (specified at casting) while touching the rope at any point along its length. Thus, a rope tied at the top of a cliff will come loose when someone at the bottom of the cliff says the password, if he can touch the rope. Knot also works for string, chastity belts, etc.
The Undo spell also unties a Knot spell, but the Knot spell gets a resistance roll.
Duration: Until the password is spoken, or the rope is cut or broken!
Cost: 2. Cannot be maintained – must be recast if the rope is untied.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Stiffen

Reshape
Regular
Mold any inanimate substance as
though it were clay. Does not convey
any additional artistic ability to the
subject, however! Any inanimate
object the subject picks up while
under this spell will soften slightly –
this can be troublesome. For instance,
if he tries to wield a sword or staff, it
does only half damage! A gun fired
while “soft” will be ruined. Any material molded will become hard again, in
its new form, as soon as the subject
removes his hands from it.
Inconvenient doors and walls can
be removed, at a double-handful of
material per second. This spell can
even be used to tunnel through rock,
but since in effect the subject is digging through soft earth with his
hands, it is slow and tiring.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Weaken,
and either Shape Earth or Shape
Plant.

Item
Gloves. Energy cost to create: 500.

Rive (VH)
Regular
Pokes holes in inanimate objects,
walls, etc. See p. B557, for the DR and
HP of common objects. This spell
works like a huge piercing attack,
punching a 2-foot-diameter hole (the
affected area may be smaller at the
caster’s discretion).
Cost: 1 per die of damage to be
inflicted to the object.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Shatter.

Item
Wand, staff, or glove. Must strike
the object. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Ruin
Regular
Accelerates the natural process of
decay on unliving materials. It rusts
iron and steel, but has little effect on
other metals unless maintained for a
very long time. It causes organic material – leather, fur, wood, plastics, etc. –
to decay to uselessness. Ceramics are
unaffected by Ruin.
Duration: 1 minute. Each 1-minute
casting has the general effect of aging
the subject 5 years. It will remove 1
DR and 1 HP from most subjects.
Weapons simply lose one grade of
quality per casting, except for Very
Fine weapons, which are unaffected!
Cost: 2 per pound of material
ruined. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds per pound
of material ruined.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Weaken,
and Decay.

Explode (VH)
Regular
As Shatter, but the subject, if it
shatters, explodes violently, doing
fragmentation damage (p. B414).
Cost: 2 to 6; does 1d damage for
every two points of energy put into it.
Double cost to increase damage to
1d+2.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Shatter,
and Apportation.

Item
Wand, staff, or glove. The item
must strike the subject. Energy cost to
create: 1,000.


Mapmaker
Special
When cast on a scroll or any other
writing surface (including a previously
unfinished map), this spell creates a
map of what the scroll’s holder
perceives.
The caster must declare the scale
used for the map, which way is north,
the spot on the scroll where mapping
begins and which features are to
appear on the map. The map thus created is of the same quality as if it had
been drawn by someone with a
Cartography skill equal to the lower of
the caster’s effective skill with this
spell and his Cartography skill. It is no
better in content than if the holder
had taken the time to write it himself
– the spell is nothing more than a
time-saver.
Duration: 1 hour. The spell does
not expire if the scroll’s user moves off
the edge of the map; it just fails to
inscribe anything until he moves back
on. The inscriptions themselves are
permanent.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites:
Inscribe
and
Measurement.

Item

Fasten
Regular
Ties up the subject with a length of
rope or chain (which is not created by
the spell, only animated). Useful
to wrap packages, moor boats, bind prisoners, and so on. An actively
resisting subject resists using DX. The
bond is a normal knot (though it may
be turned into a magical Knot by
increasing the energy expenditure).
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 3 to cast (1 extra to have a
Knot in it).
Prerequisite: Knot.


Repair
Regular
Permanently repairs a broken
inanimate object. If some small parts
are missing, skill is at -5, and the
appropriate materials to make the
missing parts must be provided – e.g.,
a lump of gold to make gold filigreework. If the spell succeeds, the missing parts reappear. Formerly magical
items do not regain their magic when
repaired (although this spell will
restore a weakened magic item to full
durability).
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 2 per 5 pounds of subject’s
weight. Minimum cost 6 for objects
with moving parts.
Time to cast: 1 second per pound
(minimum 10).
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Rejoin.

Shatterproof
Regular
Makes a small object (like a
weapon, or anything else that a normal human could hold in one hand)
resistant to breakage. A cheap or regular metal weapon is treated as a “fine”
quality weapon while the spell lasts,
and a “fine” weapon as “very fine.”
Other items have their hit points doubled, and will never break due to accidental dropping, etc. It doubles the
DR and HP of a shield if the shieldbreaking rules are used (p. B484). This
spell does not increase resistance to
“penetration,” so it’s no good for walls,
armor, etc.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Repair and Shatter.

Item
Any item can be made permanently shatterproof; if the item does break,
the pieces are no longer enchanted.
Energy cost to create: 400.

Sharpen
Regular
Temporarily produces an extraordinary sharpness on cutting and
impaling weapons. +1 or more to
basic damage.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: The formula is 1 energy for
every 6” of edge. Typical costs (use these
unless the circumstances are very special): 1 to cast on an arrow; 2 for a knife,
spear or axe; 3 for a one-handed sword;
5 for a two-handed sword. Double these
for +2 bonus, or triple for +3. Half that
(round up) to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Repair.

Item
See Puissance (p. 65). If a weapon
already has the Puissance spell on it,
the spells don’t add; only the stronger
one works.

Toughen
Regular
Makes an inanimate object more
difficult to penetrate by increasing its
DR. Has no effect on the protective
value of armor. If the object takes basic
damage equal to or greater than its
(toughened) DR, the spell is broken,
and must be recast.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 to cast per point of DR
(maximum of 8) for an object the size
of a fist, double for an object up to a
cubic foot, triple for an SM 0 object.
Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shatterproof.

Mystic Mark
Regular
Places an invisible mark on the
subject. The mark is visible to the
caster at will (simple concentration)
and to others using Aura, See Secrets,
Mage Sight, Detect Magic, or similar
spells. It may be a rune, sigil, monogram, etc. (A Heraldry specialty may
be learned to recognize the Mystic
Marks in use in the campaign world.)
Unwilling subjects resist with IQ.
Should Seeker be cast regarding a
subject bearing the caster’s Mystic
Mark, there will be no need for “something associated with the subject
sought.”
The mark can be erased with
Remove Curse.
Duration: Mystic Mark is a lasting
spell that fades with time. Every
month, roll against the Mystic Mark’s
Endurance (p. 10). On an ordinary
failure, the Mark’s Endurance is
reduced by the margin of failure. On a
critical failure or when the Mark’s
Endurance reaches 0, the spell
expires. Marks placed on durable
objects are themselves more durable;
apply the DR of the surface as a bonus
to the “fading” roll.
Cost: 3.

Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Dye and Trace.

Item
(a) The mark may be made permanent (no need for the monthly “fading”
roll) for 30 energy. (b) Staff, wand or
writing instrument (including a branding iron). Energy cost to create: 300.

Weapon Self (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
(or by effective skill
for magic weapons)
The caster’s body magically melds
with the melee weapon he is wielding.
Clothes (up to 6 pounds) disappear
along with him, but the rest of his
equipment falls to the ground. The
weapon now dances through the air,
as if wielded by an invisible opponent.
The subject keeps his weapon skill and
attributes while assuming a minimum
Speed of 5. Attacks on the weapon are
at a normal penalty for size (p. B400).
The weapon may only dodge or parry,
but has natural DR appropriate to its
material (p. B483). If the weapon is
broken, the spell ends and the subject
reappears, unharmed but physically
stunned, holding the useless weapon
in his hand(s).
The subject may not speak, so he
can only cast spells he knows at skill
20 or better. The subject’s HT resists
Making and Breaking spells such as
Weaken and Shatter.
Magic weapons resist the melding
with their Power. If the subject wishes
to activate any of the enchantments on
the magic weapon, he must win a
Regular Contest of his Will against the
weapon’s Power.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 8 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites:
Magery
2,
Apportation, and at least six Making
and Breaking spells including
Reshape.


Item
See Fortify (p. 66).

Transparency
Regular
Makes an object transparent. The
object’s outlines remain visible and its
physical characteristics remain
unchanged (hardness, weight, etc.).
The caster can choose to tint the
object as he desires instead of making
it colorless.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Dye and Stone to
Earth.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 850. (b) For 400 points
(multiplied by 1+SM), any items can
be made permanently transparent.



Transform Object (VH)
Regular; Special Resistance
Changes an object into another object of the same weight. The change can be anything – a gun could be turned into a rag doll, for instance. As with Create Object (p. 98), anything the mage brings into existence must be something he is familiar with. To turn something into a functional object, the caster must have the appro- priate skill for making a similar object; the rag doll mentioned above will be a pretty poor rag doll unless the caster has Sewing skill, and if he wants to turn a rag doll into a gun, he’d better have Armoury skill.
An object held or worn by someone resists with its owner’s Will.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 to cast for every pound the object weighs (minimum of 1 pound). Double cost to change to (or from) stone, triple for metal. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: Equal to cost, in seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Reshape, and at least four “Create” spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Contract Object (VH)
Regular
Scales an object down in one
dimension. A rope or blade can be
made shorter, for instance. This spell
could easily render most clothing
unwearable. This reduces the object’s
Size modifier unless the object is not
being contracted in its longest dimension. The object’s DR is unchanged,
but its HP usually decreases in direct
proportion to the rescaling.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 per pound of original
weight (minimum of 1 pound) for
every halving of the chosen dimension. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Transform Object.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 800.

Extend Object (VH)
Regular
Scales an object up in one dimension; the opposite of Contract Object
(above).
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 to cast for every pound the
object weighs (minimum of 1 pound).
Double cost to change to (or from)
stone, triple for metal. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: Equal to cost, in seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Reshape,
and at least four “Create” spells.




Shrink Object (VH)
Regular
Scales an object down in size
while maintaining its proportions,
decreasing its Size modifier. Multiply
weight by 1/3, and HP by 2/3, for every
subtracted point of Size modifier; subtract 1 DR for every 2 subtracted
points of Size modifier.

Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 per pound of original
weight (minimum one pound) for
every point of SM reduction. Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Contract Object.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 800.

Enlarge Object (VH)
Regular
Scales an object up in size while
maintaining its proportions, increasing its Size modifier. Multiply weight
by 3.5, and HP by 1.5, for every added
point of Size modifier; add 1 DR for
every 2 added points of Size modifier.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 per pound of original
weight (minimum of 1 pound) for
every additional point of SM. Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Extend Object.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 800.

Disintegrate (VH)
Regular
Similar to Shatter, but leaves only
dust (cannot be repaired!). If damage
rolled doesn’t destroy the subject, it is
unaffected. This spell affects inanimate objects only and cannot affect
parts of objects.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 to 4; does 1d damage for
each point of energy put into it.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Shatter,
Ruin, Earth to Air, Destroy Air, and
Destroy Water.

Item
As for Shatter. Energy cost to create:
1,500.


Counterspell
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Nullify any one ongoing spell. It
cannot “counter” spells that make a
permanent change in the world (e.g.,
Extinguish Fire, Flesh to Stone, or
Zombie), and it cannot affect permanently enchanted items, but it can
counter spells cast using magic items.
The “subject” of Counterspell may be
either the subject of the spell to be
countered or the person who cast that
spell.
Counterspell is a single spell – but
to counter a given spell, you must also
know that spell. Roll against the lower
of your Counterspell skill or your skill
with the spell being countered. You
must win a Quick Contest with the target spell to cancel it. You can cast multiple Counterspells to negate an Area
spell piece by piece.
Cost: Half that of the spell countered, not counting bonuses the other
caster got for high skill.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Suspend Spell
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Temporarily nullify any one ongoing spell. The caster must know the
spell he suspends. Suspend Spell does
not affect magic items, but can affect
spells cast through one. Spells that can
only be removed by Remove Curse
cannot be suspended; use Suspend
Curse for those.
Suspend Spell is cast at the lower of
the user’s Suspend Spell skill and his
skill with the spell being suspended.
When the suspension expires, the suspended spell “picks up where it left off”
and resumes operation. If the subject
spell is maintained, its caster will automatically know it is being suspended.
Otherwise, roll against Perception +
Magery - 3 – distance is not a factor.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1/10 that of the spell suspended to cast, not counting bonuses the
other caster may have received for
high skill (round up). Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and
Counterspell.


Scryguard
Regular; Resists any Information spells
Any information spell cast on the
subject must win a Quick Contest of
Spells with the Scryguard to “see”
him. Identify Spell still detects that the
Scryguard is present.
Duration: 10 hours.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.



Scrywall
Area; Resists any
Information spells
As Scryguard, but to protect a
whole area and everything in it.
Duration: 10 hours.
Base cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: Seconds equal to energy cost.
Prerequisite: Scryguard.

Ward
Blocking; Resisted by
subject spell
When cast immediately after a
spell is thrown at its subject, this spell
can prevent the opposed spell from
working. It works against only a single
magical attack. If an attacking spell
affects several people, each Ward can
only save one subject. It does not
protect against missile spells.
The caster may only Ward against
a spell that he knows at skill 12 or
higher; a caster who knows (for
instance) Sleep may also ward a single
subject against Mass Sleep. The caster
rolls at the lower of his Ward skill or
his skill in the spell being warded. The
caster must announce he is using
Ward before the opposed spell’s subject tries a resistance roll. If it turns
out the spell being cast is not one the
defending mage can ward against, the
ward is wasted.
Cost: 2 to cast it on yourself, or 3 to
cast on anyone you can see. You cannot Ward someone you cannot see.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Conceal Magic
Regular
Cast on a single person or item,
this spell interferes with any informational spell cast on the subject. Twice
the energy put into the spell (up to 5
points) is subtracted from any skill
roll made to learn about the item, find
it, etc.
Example: 4 points of energy are put
into a Conceal Magic spell on a ring.
Until the spell expires, any Detect
Magic spell will be at -8 to work on
that ring; Identify Magic will be at -8
to find any spells on the ring; Mage
Sight will not see the ring unless the
mage made his roll by at least 8
(though he may still see other things)
– and so on.
Note that this spell has similar
effects in some ways to Scryguard
(p. 121), but they’re not the same!
Duration: 10 hours.
Cost: 1 through 5 to cast. Same cost
to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Detect
Magic.

Item
This spell may be cast permanently
on any item to make it harder to sense
or identify with magic. Energy cost to
cast: 100 times the cost above – e.g.,
200 to give a -4 on all attempts to
detect or identify.

Reflect
Blocking; Resisted by
subject spell
This spell is an improved version
of Ward, and works like it. The difference is that it will reflect the opposed
spell instead of negating it. Thus, if
the Reflect succeeds, the opposed
spell now attacks its original caster as
if it had been cast on him to begin
with. If the attacking spell is an area
spell, a successful Reflect protects its
subject and affects the caster as
though he were in the area being
attacked, but otherwise the area is
still attacked normally.
Cost: 4 to cast it on yourself, 6 to cast
it on someone you can see; you cannot
protect someone you cannot see.
Prerequisite: Ward.

Item
(a) Any container. It, and everything inside, is protected by the
Scrywall spell. Energy cost to cast: 200
per cubic foot (minimum cost 500).
(b) Any rug or area of floor; protects
people and things standing atop it.
Energy cost to cast: 300 per yard
radius.

Great Ward
Blocking; Resisted by
subject spell
As Ward, but – if it works – protects
any number of those who would have
been affected by the attacking spell.
Cost: 1 per subject protected (minimum cost 4).
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Ward.

False Aura
Regular, Area; Special
Resistance; Resists Information
spells
Replaces the magical emanations
of a being, area, or object with false
ones; the term “aura” is only literal for
living things. For instance, a human
could be made to have the aura of a
Zombie, a sword could appear to be
enchanted with Dancing Weapon, an
area could appear to be under linked
Create Fire and Glue spells, etc. Roll a
Quick Contest between the False Aura
and any spell (Information or
Regular) that can see or detect the
emanations (such as Aura, Mage
Sight, or Analyze Magic). If the False
Aura wins, the other spell is fooled.
False Aura also works against
equivalent senses some creatures may
possess.
Unwilling subjects resist with IQ.
The chosen False Aura must be familiar to the caster – a mage could not put
a False Aura of Golem on a statue
unless he knew the Golem spell, for
instance.
Duration: 10 hours.
Cost: 4 to cast. Half that to maintain. When cast on an area, the base
cost is 4.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Conceal Magic and
Aura.

Item
(a) Any. Only affects the holder.
Energy cost to create: 300. (b) Any object
or area may be given a permanent False
Aura for 100 times casting cost.

Magic Resistance
Regular; Resisted by Will+Magery
For each point of energy put into
the spell (up to 5), the subject’s magic
resistance goes up by 2 if he is willing,
or by 1 if he tried to resist. This MR
works like normal Magic Resistance
(p. B67) when spells are cast on the
subject. The subject can still cast
spells, but at a penalty equal to the
MR. Spells already affecting the subject (or already cast by him) continue
unchanged. He can use potions and
magical items normally.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 5 to cast. Same cost to
maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and one or
more spells from each of seven
different colleges.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, weapon, or jewelry;
only affects the wearer. Usable by anyone, but energy cost is doubled for
nonmages. Energy cost to create: 300
per maximum point of magic resistance it can offer. (b) Any item. The
item’s own magic resistance is
increased by 1 through 10; the user’s
magic resistance is unaffected. Energy
cost to create: 200 per point of added
magic resistance. Does not affect spellcasting ability of its user.



Penetrating Spell
Regular
This spell is cast on another damage-dealing spell, granting it an armor
divisor (p. B378). The spells are cast
one after the other, with no delays
between castings. Penetrating Spell is
cast first, and counts as a spell “on” for
determining the effective skill for the
second spell.
A spell fortified with Penetrating
Spell does not do extra damage to
unarmored foes. Hardened DR
defends against the armor divisor
conferred by this spell as normal.
Duration: Until the second spell
expires.
Cost: See table below.
Armor Divisor     Cost
2                 2
3                 4
5                 6
10                8
Ignores DR        10
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Delay and Find
Weakness.

Catch Spell (VH)
Blocking; Special
When cast immediately after a Missile spell is thrown (not when it is cast), this spell allows its caster to catch the missile as it comes within reach of him. Once caught, the spell can be held by the caster just as if he himself had
cast it, to be thrown later (back at its original caster, perhaps . . . ). The caster need not know the spell he is catching.
If the Catch Spell roll succeeds, its caster physically catches the missile when it comes close enough to grab. If the Catch Spell roll fails, its caster gets hit dead-on by the spell (on a critical failure, he takes maximum damage from the spell!).
Cost: 3.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, DX 12 or higher, and Return Missile.

Scryfool
Regular; Special Resistance
Redirect Information spells targeted at a first subject onto a second subject, the “decoy.” Both subjects must be
present at casting time; add the range penalties, if any. Unwilling subjects resist with Will.
From then on, any Information spell attempting to scry the first sub- ject must win a Quick Contest of Spells with the Scryfool to scry the correct subject. Otherwise, it scries the decoy instead.
Duration: 10 hours.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds. Prerequisites: Magery 2, Sense
Observation, and Simple Illusion.

Suspend Magic
Area; Resisted by subject spells
Temporarily nullify all other spells
within the area. It has no effect on
enchanted items. Certain powerful
spells are also unaffected – specifically, those which can only be removed
by Remove Curse. Each spell resists
separately.
Suspend Magic is not selective; the
caster can choose the shape of the
area within the boundaries he pays
energy for (as with all Area spells), but
may not exclude objects within the
affected area. The caster need not
know the spell(s) being suspended. To
suspend a specific spell without
affecting others, use Suspend Spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 second per energy
point spent.
Prerequisites: Suspend Spell and at
least eight other spells of any type.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,500.

Displace Spell
Regular; Resisted by subject spell
Changes the location of an Area
spell, permanently. Certain powerful
spells are unaffected – specifically, those
which can only be removed by Remove
Curse. Each Area spell must be displaced separately, except linked spells,
which move together. The caster need
not know the spell being displaced.
Once the casting is complete, the area moves with Move equal to the caster’s Magery. Each turn, the dis- placed spell gets a new resistance roll; once it successfully resists, it stops moving and the Displace Spell is bro- ken – though it may be cast anew. The subject spell always rolls to resist, even if its caster doesn’t wish it to (the caster’s own spells resist at -5).
While being Displaced, the subject spell remains active (thus, the caster could trigger a Link by moving it over its intended target). If the subject spell is being maintained, its caster will auto- matically know it is being displaced. Otherwise, roll against Perception + Magery - 3 – distance is not a factor.
Duration: Until the caster stops concentrating or the subject spell resists successfully.
Cost: 1/4 that of the spell being moved, not counting bonuses the other caster may have gotten for high skill (round up).
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Suspend Magic.

Spell Shield
Area; Resists all spells cast through it
Resist any spell cast through it at
the Spell Shield’s Endurance (p. 10). It
also acts as a Scrywall (above).
Exception: It does not affect missile
spells at all, including Thrown spells.
Note that if the attacking spell wins
the contest, it gets through, but the
Spell Shield is not destroyed – instead,
its Endurance is reduced by 1. When a
Spell Shield’s Endurance is reduced to
0, the spell dissipates and cannot be
maintained.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Scryguard,
and Magic Resistance.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000.


Spell Wall
Regular; Resists spells
cast through it
Creates a wall of anti-magic. The
wall resists any spell cast through it
from one side, specified by the caster
upon casting Spell Wall. It also acts as
a Scrywall. Exception: It does not
affect Missile spells at all, including
Thrown spells.
If the Spell Wall fails to resist a
spell cast through it, the spell breaks
through, but the wall still stands, its
Endurance (p. 10) weakened by 1.
Upon reaching Endurance 0, the wall
dissipates. Spells passing through the
wall from the “safe” direction (usually
the side that the caster stands on!) are
not resisted or affected in any way.
The wall is cast in one-yard increments, either all at once or piece by
piece. When adding new segments to a
weakened Spell Wall, the new segments assume the Endurance of the
“weakest link.” The only way to
“repair” a weakened Wall is to cast it
anew.
The Spell Wall is four yards high,
so it is possible to cast across it from a
high enough elevation. Higher walls
can be created by spending proportionately more energy (double energy
for double height, and so on).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 per one-yard piece of Wall
to cast. Same cost to maintain. The
Spell Wall may also be cast horizontally, as a “ceiling” or “floor”; each
point of energy will then cover two
hexes on a battle map.
Prerequisite: Spell Shield.

Item
A Spell Wall may be made permanent for 100 times casting cost. Mages
often cover windows or skylights in
this fashion. “Permanent” Spell Walls
do not weaken when penetrated.

Pentagram
Special; Resists attempts to cross it
Produces a magical barrier, which
blocks hostile spells and magical creatures from passing in either direction.
The barrier is a star-shaped figure
drawn on the floor or ground. Magical
creatures (demons, golems, creations,
zombies, elementals, and the like) cannot cross the border of a pentagram;
neither may they cast spells, or move
any physical object, across the border.
Nonmagical creatures – including
mages – can freely cross a pentagram,
though they cannot cast spells across
its border. Spells of transport (e.g.,
Flight, Teleport) cannot be used to
enter a pentagram for hostile purposes.
Certain very hostile creatures may
be summoned within a pentagram; the
caster stands outside and summons
the creature to a spot inside the pentagram. The caster will open the
pentagram only when he is sure he can
control the summoned creature.

If part of the pentagram is cut or
erased, its power will be lost until the
caster can rejoin the pentagram – all
this requires is a piece of chalk and
time (usually just a second) to draw
the line. No magic spell can injure the
pentagram, but physical attacks – like
walking up and scuffing out a line
with your shoe – can succeed if they
are made by nonmagical beings. A
demon or creation could not do it; an
ordinary person could. Likewise, an
ordinary person could throw a rock
into a pentagram, but a demon or
golem could not.
A magical creature may try to force
its way through a pentagram. Roll a
contest between the creature’s
(ST+Will)/2 and the skill with which
the pentagram was cast. If the creature wins, it destroys the pentagram!
No one creature can thus “test” a
pentagram more than once per day.
Duration: Permanent unless
broken.
Cost: 1 per square foot protected
(minimum 10). When the spell is cast
ceremonially, the casters can spend
extra energy to increase the effective
skill of the Pentagram. A mage can
also use the Slow and Sure
Enchantment
method

Pentagram is not technically an

Suspend Curse
Regular; Resisted by subject spell
Temporarily nullifies any one of the
following spells, among others: Alter
(any type), Curse, Enlarge Other,
Ensorcelment (any type), Flesh to Ice,
Geas (either type), Healing Slumber,
Hex, Malefice, Mystic Mark, Oath,
Partial Petrification, Plant Form (any
type), Possession (any type), Shapeshift
(any type), Shrink Other, Stone to
Flesh, Stop Healing, Strike Barren,
Suspend Magery, Suspend Time. It will
also suspend any physical or mental
impairment caused by an hostile Wish
of any kind. If for any reason the skill
level of the subject spell is unknown,
the GM’s assessment is final.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 10. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and spells
from at least 12 different colleges.

Suspend Mana (VH)
Area
The subject area is (temporarily) a
no-mana zone, dead to the flow of
magic. A critical failure costs the
caster a level of Magery for 2d days. At
the end of that time, the caster should
roll vs. IQ+Magery; any roll except a
critical failure means that the lost
Magery is regained – a critical failure
means the loss is permanent!
Duration: The mana is restored at a
rate depending on the surrounding
mana level. In a low-mana zone, the
area affected by the spell shrinks by
one yard in radius every three days; in
normal mana, by one yard every hour;
in high mana or very high mana, by
one yard every minute!
Base cost: 5. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 minutes.
Prerequisites: Suspend Magic and
spells from at least 10 different
colleges.

Item
Mages’ Guilds may have permanent pentagrams, inlaid with tile or
jewels to avoid accidental scuffing,
and cast at a very high level of skill.
Such a design can be ritually “cut,”
when necessary, by a chalk-mark. But
there is no intrinsic difference
between these and a regular pentagram – any pentagram is “permanent”
until erased or broken. (If a hostile
creature breaks through a Pentagram
spell, it destroys the enchantment but
does not affect the physical design,
which can be re-enchanted later . . . if
its owner survives.)

Dispel Magic
Area; Resisted by
subject spells
Negates other spells within the
area if successful. It has no effect on
enchantments, but dispels any temporary, lasting, or permanent spell
(p. 10), unless the spell specifies otherwise. Each spell resists separately.
Dispel Magic is not selective! The caster need not know the spell(s) being
dispelled. To nullify a specific spell
without affecting others, use
Counterspell, above.
Duration: Dispelled magic is permanently gone.
Base cost: 3.
Time to cast: 1 second for each energy point spent.
Prerequisites: Counterspell and at least 12 other spells of any type.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. The mage loans the subject
spell by activating the item and physically passing the item to the recipient;
the item must be held at all times for
the magic to work – it may not be
thrown. The recipient “owns” the spell
for as long as he holds the item, and
may pass it along to yet another recipient, whether or not either is a mage.
Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Remove Curse
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Nullifies any one of the following
spells: Alter (any type), Curse, Enlarge
Other, Ensorcelment (any type), Flesh
to Ice, Geas (either type), Healing
Slumber, Hex, Malefice, Mystic Mark,
Oath, Partial Petrification, Plant Form
(any type), Possession (any type),
Shapeshift (any type), Shrink Other,
Stone to Flesh, Stop Healing, Strike
Barren, Suspend Magery, Suspend
Time. It also negates any physical or
mental impairment caused by a hostile
Wish of any kind. If for any reason the
skill level of the subject spell is
unknown, the GM’s assessment is final.
Cost: 20.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
one spell from each of 15 different
colleges.
Duration: Dispelled magic is
permanently gone.
Base cost: 3.
Time to cast: 1 second for each
energy point spent.
Prerequisites: Counterspell and at
least 12 other spells of any type.


Lend Spell
Regular
“Lend” an already-cast maintain- able spell to someone else. The recipi- ent acquires full control over and responsibility for the loaned spell, just
as if he had cast it himself; he can
maintain it or manipulate it at will,
within the limits of the spell itself.
The recipient must meet all of the
advantage and attribute qualifications
of the loaned spell, but need not know
its spell prerequisites. Thus, a spell
requiring Magery 2 could only be
loaned to a character with Magery 2,
but a spell requiring no Magery and
no special advantages or attributes
could be loaned to anybody. If the
recipient has Magic Resistance, Lend
Spell must overcome it.
Lend Spell is cast at the lower of the caster’s skill with Lend Spell and the subject spell. The caster must touch the recipient.
Modifiers: If the recipient does not know all the prerequisites of the spell to be loaned, the caster gets a -2 to skill. If the recipient knows all the pre- requisites, the spell is cast at par. If the recipient actually knows the spell, the caster gets a +2.
Duration: Permanent. Once the spell is "loaned", the spell no longer belongs to its original caster.
Cost: Equal to the maintenance cost of the spell to be lent.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Lend Skill, and spells from at least six different colleges.

Charge Powerstone (VH)
Regular
Recharges a Powerstone at a higher rate than the stone recharges itself.
Every 3 energy spent by the caster
restores 1 point of energy to the stone,
but every point restored is counted as
an “advance” against future “natural”
recharging. Thus, if a 10-point
Powerstone is recharged with this
spell in a normal-mana area, it will
not begin to recharge for 10 days after
it is used. If it is used, and then
recharged again using this spell, it
will be 20 days until the stone begins

to recharge normally, and so on. The
presence of multiple Powerstones
does not inhibit the casting of this
spell.
On any ordinary failure with this
spell, the Powerstone gains a new
quirk (p. 69). On a critical failure, the
Powerstone cracks and is destroyed.
This spell can safely recharge
Powerstones with quirks that limit
recharging only if the conditions
imposed by the quirk have been met.
Attempts to ignore those conditions
may cause the Powerstone to shatter.
This spell does not work on
Manastones.
Duration: The energy remains in
the Powerstone until needed.
Cost: 3 per point of energy
recharged.
Time to cast: 10 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Powerstone, and Lend Energy.

Spellguard (VH)
Regular; Resists attempts to
tamper with its subject spell
This spell is cast on another spell to
protect it from tampering attempts.
Twice the energy put into the spell (up
to 3 points) is subtracted from the skill
of any casting of the following Metaspells against the subject spell:
Counterspell, Displace Spell, False
Aura, Remove Aura, Remove Curse,
Steal Spell, Suspend Curse, and
Suspend Spell. Twice the energy put
into the Spellguard is added to the
effective skill of the subject spell’s caster when resisting Dispel Magic or
Suspend Magic. When the spell it protects lapses or is dispelled, the
Spellguard also lapses.
Duration: 10 hours.
Cost: 1 to 3 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. Cost is not reduced for high
skill.
Time to cast: 1 second for each
energy point spent.
Prerequisite: Dispel Magic.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
500. (b) May be cast permanently on
an enchanted item or area to make it
harder to tamper with; it then hampers
Suspend Enchantment and Remove
Enchantment as well. Energy cost to
cast: 100 times normal cost.

Remove Aura
Regular; Special Resistance;
Resists Information spells
Like False Aura, but removes the
magical emanations of the subject
entirely. When cast on an inanimate
object, this spell turns it into a blank
slate for spells such as Ancient
History, History, See Secrets, or
Seeker (in the latter case, the Remove
Aura breaks the “association,” so the
Seeker is cast at -5). To resolve this,
any future casting of the aforementioned spells is resisted by the Remove
Aura – whenever the other spell fails,
the information it tried to access was
successfully removed. Whatever happens to the object after its aura is
removed can still be freely accessed by
those spells, of course.
When cast on a living or magical
subject, the Remove Aura only lasts
one day and cannot be maintained. It
interferes with such spells as Aura,
Detect Magic, Seek Magic, or Mage
Sight. Unwilling subject beings resist
with Will.
Duration: Permanent (but see
above).
Cost: 5.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Dispel Magic and
Aura.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages; the item must touch
the subject. Energy cost to create: 250.
(b) Jewelry or clothing. Always on;
only affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 750.

Drain Mana (VH)
Area
Remove all mana from an area,
leaving it permanently “dead” to
magic. Spells do not work there, and
magic cannot sense anyone or anything in a no-mana zone; magical
spells end, and magical items do not
function until they are removed from
the area.
This spell is used to create areas in
which mages, magical creatures, and
magical objects can safely be confined
or hidden. A no-mana zone stays stable
with respect to the earth, but not to
objects. Thus, if you make the inside of
a box mana-dead, when you move the
box, the dead space will stay where it
was, rather than moving with the box.
A critical failure with this spell
costs the caster one level of Magery!
Duration: Permanent.
Base cost: 10.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisites: Dispel Magic and
Suspend Mana.

Restore Mana (VH)
Area
The reverse of Drain Mana;
restores mana to a dead zone. The
area gains a mana equal to the “average” mana level of the surrounding
area, regardless of what it might have
been before. Cost, time, and prerequisites are the same as for Drain Mana,
but there is no risk of losing Magery.
Duration: Permanent.
Base cost: 10.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisites: Dispel Magic and
Suspend Mana.


Steal Spell (VH)
Regular; Resisted by
subject spell
Steal control of an already-cast
maintainable spell from its original
caster. Note that it is cast at the other
spell’s caster and is therefore subject to
range modifiers. The caster must
know precisely what he is stealing –
Identify Spell is very useful for this
purpose. Spells operating under
Maintain Spell can also be stolen; the
“caster,” for range purposes, is then
the maintained spell’s area or subject.
You cannot steal a spell if you do
not have the required Magery, advantage, attribute level, or lack of disadvantage (see conditions under Lend
Spell, above). A held Missile cannot be
stolen.
Modifiers: -3 if the caster does not
know the spell he is stealing; a further
-2 if the caster doesn’t know its prerequisites either.
Duration: Permanent; once stolen,
the spell no longer belongs to its
original caster.
Cost: Equal to the maintenance
cost of the spell to be stolen.
Time to cast: 1 second per energy
point spent.
Prerequisites: Lend Spell and Great
Ward.

Telecast (VH)
Special
Create and teleport a Wizard Eye
to a distant location. The caster may
then cast spells through the Wizard
Eye as if he was present. Missiles may
not be telecast, but Jet spells may.
Spells requiring touch may also be
telecast, but the Wizard Eye must
score a hit and the defender must fail
his defense.
Use the cost and casting penalties
from the Teleport spell (p. 147). Spells
cast from the Telecast’s “other end”
measure range from that spot. The
Telecast counts as a spell “on” and
requires concentration. GMs who
wish to further limit this powerful
spell may apply the penalties for no
speech, foot, or hand motions (p. 9).
If the Telecast roll is failed by 1, the
Wizard Eye reaches its intended destination but the caster is mentally
stunned. If the roll is failed by more
than 1, the Wizard Eye winds up
somewhere else (GM’s choice!) and
the caster is still mentally stunned. In
all cases, a Body Sense roll at a -2
penalty is required before the caster
can get his bearings and start casting
another spell; on a critical failure, he is
mentally stunned.
There are persistent rumors of
variants of this spell which Timeport
or Plane Shift the Wizard Eye instead.
Duration: 5 seconds.
Cost: As Teleport to cast; same cost
to maintain. High skill does not
reduce the cost. The energy is spent
whether the spell is successful or not.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Teleport,
Wizard Eye, and spells from at least 10
different colleges.

Item
An eyeball carved of ivory and inset
with jewels. Usable only by mages. At
its holder’s command, it teleports itself
away; when the spell lapses, it reappears in the holder’s hand (unless it
has been physically destroyed). Cost to
create: 1,900 energy, $1,000 for skilled
ivory carving, $600 for jewels.

Hang Spell (VH)
Special
This spell is cast on another spell to
delay its activation until the caster wills
it. Blocking spells may not be hung.
Hang Spell is cast immediately
before its subject spell, with no delays
between castings. The caster rolls for
the Hang Spell when it is cast; the roll
for the subject spell is not made until it
is activated. Range penalties, spells
“on,” magic resistance, mana level
changes and the like are applied at the
subject spell’s activation time.
The caster must pay full energy
and time costs for the Hang Spell and
its subject must be paid at the time of
casting. If the caster hangs a spell tailored to a human-sized subject and
then activates it on a larger subject,
there is either no effect or a reduced
effect, as the GM sees fit.
A hung spell counts as one spell
“on” (p. 10) for casting purposes; it
does not, however, count against itself
when it is activated. Thus, if a mage
has four hung spells, he casts other
spells at -4, but casts any one of the
hung spells at -3. A hung spell takes a
Concentrate action to activate.
Hung spells are susceptible to
Dispel Magic and Counterspell (which
destroys them), as well as to Suspend
Magic and Suspend Spell (which prevents them from activating for the
duration). They cannot be stolen or
lent because they have not yet been
cast.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: Same as the underlying spell’s
cost to cast (minimum of 2); same cost
to maintain. The hung spell may be
maintained normally once it has taken
effect.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Delay.

Maintain Spell (VH)
Special
This spell is cast on one of the caster’s ongoing spells, providing it a pool
of energy to maintain itself. Once
Maintain Spell has been cast, the subject spell draws its maintenance energy from Maintain Spell. It no longer
belongs to its original caster; it no
longer counts as a spell “on,” may not
be cancelled, etc. Maintain Spell may
be cast any time the subject spell is
active. Some maintained spells
may be “programmed” as per
Independence (p. 96) or perhaps even
Initiative (p. 97) (GM’s discretion).
Control of a spell operating under
Maintain Spell can be stolen using
Steal Spell.
Duration: Until the energy pool is
drained or the underlying spell lapses.
Cost: Equal to the normal maintenance of the subject spell for as long
as the caster wants it to last (including
the caster’s cost reductions for high
skill). Thus, a spell that costs 1 per
minute to maintain could be set to
maintain itself for 10 minutes at a cost
of 10 energy.
If the caster can maintain the spell
indefinitely for no energy cost (due to
high skill), the cost is 1 energy for
every five full duration periods. Thus,
a mage with Earthquake at skill 20
could set the spell to last 30 minutes
for 6 energy. High skill with this spell
likewise reduces cost normally!
Time to cast: 2 seconds, plus
“programming time” if necessary.
Prerequisite: Link.

Throw Spell
Missile; Special
This spell is cast on another spell,
transforming it into a Missile spell.
The spells are cast one after the other,
with no delays between castings. The
Throw Spell is cast first and counts as
a spell “on” when determining the skill
level of the subject spell (p. 10).
The caster must pay full energy
and time costs for Throw Spell and its
subject at the time of casting; if the
caster throws a spell powered for a
human-sized subject at a larger subject, there is either no effect or a
reduced effect, as the GM sees fit.
The caster rolls for the Throw Spell
when it is cast; the roll for the subject
spell is not made until it is thrown.
Thrown spells have 1/2D n/a, Max 80,
Acc 1; roll against DX-4 or Innate
Attack skill to hit.
All thrown spells take effect at the
moment they hit something. Thrown
Area spells center on their point of
impact. Jet spells take effect at the
point of impact, in the direction they
were going (treat them as Wild Swings,
p. B388). Most other spells simply
allow the caster to use spells at longer
ranges than normally possible – a
thrown Sense Emotion, for instance,
or Minor Healing. This spell allows
spells that normally require touch to
be applied at a distance (Deathtouch,
for instance). Missile spells and
Blocking spells may not be thrown.
Thrown spells may be blocked or
dodged, but not parried. However,
they can be caught using Catch Spell –
by anyone, including enemies!
Duration: Until thrown.
Cost: 3. The thrown spell may be
maintained normally once it has taken
effect.

Bless
Regular
A general spell of aid and protection. It must be cast on another; you
cannot bless yourself. In some game
worlds, only holy men or “good” wizards can cast this spell; this decision is
the GM’s to make.
The effect of a blessing is as follows: All the subject’s die rolls are modified favorably by one point (or more, for a more powerful blessing). The modifi- cation will not affect critical successes and failures. This lasts indefinitely . . . until the subject fails some die roll (or a foe makes a good die roll) and the subject is in some serious danger. Then the blessing miraculously averts or reduces the danger – and ends. It is up to the GM to decide when the blessing has its final effect, and what form the protection takes. If an arrow is aimed
at your heart, a 1-point blessing might
move it to your arm, while a 2-point
one would send it through your hat,
and a 3-point one would let it slay a foe
behind you.
Duration: As above.
Cost: 10 for a 1-point blessing, 50
for a 2-point blessing, 500 for a 3-point
blessing. Blessings may not be
“stacked” – a stronger blessing dispels
a weaker one.
Time to cast: 1 minute for every
point of energy in the spell.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
two spells from each of 10 different
colleges. Magery 3 is required to cast a
3-point blessing. A GM may require
“holy” or “good” status if he wishes.

Item
Any. The blessing is cast on the
item rather than a person, and affects
the wearer of the item. When the
blessing finally averts some great danger, the item loses its enchantment.
Energy cost to cast: 10 times the cost to
cast on a person.

Curse
Regular
Exactly the opposite of Bless. All
the subject’s die rolls are modified
unfavorably, lasting until he scores
some notable success despite the bad
rolls – GM’s decision as to exactly
what this is. Then the success turns
somehow to ashes, and the curse is
ended.
Cost: 3 for a 1-point Curse, 10 for a
2-point Curse, 20 for a 3-point Curse.
Like Blessings, Curses cannot be
“stacked.”
Time to cast: 2 seconds for a 1-point
Curse, 4 for a 2-point Curse, 6 for a 3point Curse.
Prerequisites: As for Bless, except
that both very good and very evil
characters can curse.


Prerequisites: Delay and Catch
Spell.


Item
Any. The curse is cast on the item
rather than a person, and affects the
wearer of the item. GMs should make
rolls in secret, and otherwise do whatever they can, to keep players from
realizing they have encountered a
cursed item! When the Curse delivers
its final “zap,” the enchantment vanishes. Energy cost to cast: 10 times the
cost to cast on a person.

Suspend Magery (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will+Magery
Temporarily nullifies the subject’s
Magery. The caster must touch the
subject throughout the casting. The
subject retains his knowledge of
spells, but cannot cast them – unless
he is in a high-mana area, of course, in
which case he simply loses the bonus.
Even in a high-mana area, the subject
cannot cast spells that require Magery
of any level. Suspend Magery can only
be removed by Remove Curse.
A critical failure with this spell
costs the caster a level of Magery for
2d days. At the end of that time, the
caster should roll vs. IQ+Magery; any
roll except a critical failure means that
the lost Magery is regained – a critical
failure means the loss is permanent!

Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 12 to cast. Same cost to maintain. However, the subject gets to
resist every time the spell is
maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and two
spells from at least 10 different
colleges.

Item
Clothing or jewelry (shackles are a
favorite). Always on; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 2,200.

Drain Magery (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will+Magery
Permanently drains one level of the
subject’s Magery advantage. The caster
must touch the subject throughout the
casting.
The subject retains his knowledge
of spells (albeit at a lower skill level),
but cannot cast those that require a
higher degree of Magery than his new
one.
A critical failure with this spell
costs the caster a degree of Magery
and a point of IQ!
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 30.
Time to cast: 10 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 3
Suspend Magery.

Item
There are persistent rumors of
malevolent items that drain Magery
from their victims, but nothing
specific is known.

Delay
Regular
This spell is cast on another spell to
delay its activation until a certain
thing happens in the linked spell’s
presence – that is, in the presence of
the item or area on which the linked
spell was cast. This triggering event
may be as simple or complex as the
caster desires; if complex, it should be
put in writing. The triggering event
must be something that could reasonably be determined by a normal person at the Delay site; the GM’s decision
is final. If the Delay is to be triggered
by a more esoteric event, an appropriate spell such as Mage Sight may be
cast on the Delay. The Delay may also
be triggered by the activation of
another spell, such as Watchdog or
another linked spell. A Delay can
activate only one other spell.
The spells are cast one after the
other, with no delays between spells.
The Delay must be cast first, and
counts as a spell “on” when determining the skill level of the linked spell –
see p. 10. Full cost for the linked spell
and for the Delay must be paid at the
time of casting. If the caster specifies a
spell to affect a human-sized subject,
and a larger victim (requiring more
energy – see p. 11) actually triggers the
Delay, there is either no effect or
reduced effect, depending on the spell.
The GM’s ruling on this is final.
Delay may be cast two ways: to activate the linked spell on a specific subject, or as a trap, to activate the linked
spell against any subject that meets the
triggering conditions. In the latter case,
the Delay and the linked spell are both
cast on a “trap item,” and range is figured from the trap item at the moment
the spell is triggered. Magic Resistance
penalties also apply to the linked spell
at the time of triggering.
The caster rolls for Delay when it is
first cast; the roll for the linked spell is
not made until the triggering event
occurs. If the intended subject of a
linked spell is not present at the time of
casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the
Link) for not being able to touch or see
the subject – see p. 11. So, for instance,
the dreaded “deathtouch doorknob,” set
to “attack” the first person to touch it,
would activate at a -5 penalty.
When a Delay is triggered, the
linked spell begins to activate, taking
effect the next turn. Thus, a Delay cannot be used as a Blocking spell. It can
be used as a trap; the victim may be
taken by surprise. An unsuspecting
victim must make an IQ roll to
respond before the linked spell is fully
activated – Combat Reflexes gives +6
to this roll.

Both the Delay and the linked spell
count as “on” for spellcasting purposes; if an Information spell has been
added, it is also on. The linked spell
does not need to be maintained,
though the Delay or its Information
spell may need to be. Once the Delay is
triggered, it vanishes, and no longer
counts as on. The linked spell continues to count as on as long as it is
active. It may be maintained normally.
A Delay may also be set to “turn
off” an ongoing spell when a triggering
event occurs. In that case, the linked
spell lasts only while the caster maintains it, but the Delay itself requires no
maintenance.
Blocking and Missile spells cannot
be Delayed – all other spells can. An
“instantaneous” spell like Thunderclap
will happen once, when activated; then
the spell will be gone. A continuing
spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires.
Duration: 2 hours.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and any 15
spells.

Link
Area
Postpones the activation of one or
more linked spells cast in its area of
effect, until a certain thing happens in
the Link’s presence. This triggering
event may be as simple or complex as
the caster desires, and is governed like
Delay (above). The Link may also be
triggered by the activation of a spell
placed on the area after the Link, such
as Watchdog, Delay or another Link.
The caster pays the energy costs
and makes the skill rolls for the Link
spell and all linked spells at the time
of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high
skill. If the intended subject of a
linked spell is not present at the time
of casting, there is an additional -5
penalty for the linked spell (but not
for the Link) for not being able to
touch or see the subject – see p. 11.
The size of the area of the Link spell
is determined at the time of casting.
Any linked spells may go off anywhere
within the Linked area; for instance, if a
one-yard-radius Create Fire and oneyard-radius Glue spell were linked to a
20-yard-radius Link to catch intruders,

the first intruder to enter the Link’s area
would find himself in a zone of flaming
glue, but subsequent intruders would
be safe (from that Link, anyway). The
size of the linked spells must be set at
the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell
either has no effect, or a weaker effect,
depending on the spell. The GM’s ruling
on this is final.
Only subjects within the Linked area
are affected, unless the spell results in
an effect that would not be bound to
that area – summoning a demon, for
example! The triggering event may
occur outside of the area, however.
The time to cast the linked spells is
spent when initially set up. There is no
delay when the Link is triggered – all
linked spells are activated instantly.
The linked spells do not count as a
spell “on” for any purpose. Every three
Link spells on count as one spell on,
rounding down. A mage cannot detect
a Link simply by looking at it. The
Mage Sight spell or the Detect Magic
spell will reveal the Link, however.
If the mage knows the Conceal
Magic spell, the Link may be made
harder to detect by magical means.
Simply adding the Conceal Magic costs
to the base cost of the Link spell accomplishes this effect. The mage must know
Conceal Magic to use this option.
If the subject of a linked spell is not
present at the casting, and has Magic
Resistance, refer to the original die roll
to determine the results. If the original
die roll of the linked spell is not recorded, reroll the spell for this purpose only.
Blocking and missile spells cannot
be Linked – other spells can. An
“instantaneous” spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated;
then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when
activated, and then operate until it
expires.
A single Link can be made to activate a spell when the area is entered,
and deactivate the spell when the area
is left. This may continue until the
linked spell expires. As an example, a
mage may cast Link on Continual
Light. If he then rolls seven days for
the duration of the Continual Light
spell (168 hours), he can have the Link
set up to turn the Light on when he
enters the room, and turn it off when
he leaves. When 168 hours of light
have been used, both spells expire. For
instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes
after activating the other spells.
No maintenance of a Link is
required, either for the Link itself, the
linked spells, or any information spells
cast on the Link to tell it when to
trigger.
Link may also be set in reverse, to
stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the
linked spell will last only while the
caster maintains it, but the Link itself
requires no maintenance.
Link can also be used for Limiting
Enchantments (see pp. 68-69).
Duration: Until triggered, and its
linked spells expire.
Base cost: 8; linked spells cannot be
maintained.
Time to cast: 4 hours – there is no
reduction in time to cast, no matter
how well Link is learned.
Prerequisite: Delay.

Item
This spell may be cast permanently
on any enchanted item, to determine
the circumstances under which it
works. The Limit spell would be used
to determine the class of users that
could use the item, but Link might be
used, for instance, to make it work
only at night. Energy cost to cast: 200.
Any Information spells required to tell
it when to trigger (e.g., Detect Magic)
must be cast as separate enchantments on the item. For instance, a
sword might be Linked with a Light
spell and a Sense Life spell, so that it
would glow in the presence of orcs.
A reversed Link may be cast permanently on any enchanted item, to
deactivate it under set circumstances.
This is often used to keep magic items
from falling into the wrong hands.
Energy cost to cast: 200.

Reflex
Special
This spell is cast on another spell. It
converts that spell to function as a
Blocking spell for one time only, then
disappear. Unlike Delay or Link, a
Reflexed spell is triggered by the will
of the caster, not by an external event.
This means that while Reverse
Missiles may be Reflexed to activate if
the caster sees someone shoot at him,
it will not be triggered by a shot in the
back. It is treated as an active defense,
similar to Parry or Block for all practical purposes (except retreating does
not add 3 to the roll). Casting a
Reflexed spell will interrupt any spell
the caster is concentrating on, and is
handled like any other Blocking spell –
see pp. 12-13.
When Reflex is cast, the linked
spell must be cast immediately after
Reflex, by the same caster. Each casting of Reflex will only work on one
spell – it is not possible to have multiple spells operate as one Blocking
spell. The skill roll for Reflex is rolled
at the time of casting, but the roll for
the linked spell is not made until it is
cast as a Blocking spell. The energy
cost for Reflex is paid at the time of
casting Reflex, but the energy for the
Reflexed spell is not paid until it is
cast, whether as an active defense or
otherwise. The time to cast a Reflexed
spell is spent immediately after the
Reflex is cast, but the success roll and
energy cost are handled later.

A Reflexed spell counts as one spell
“on” for spellcasting purposes – see
p. 10. A Reflexed spell does not count
as “on” when making the roll to cast
itself. Thus, if a mage has four
Reflexed spells on, any other spell he
casts is at -4, but when he casts one of
the Reflexed spells, it is only at -3 for
the other three Reflexed spells on.

Note that a mage may cast a Reflex
on another person. The caster (not the
subject) may activate it at any time,
using long-distance modifiers. If the
linked spell is cast on a subject other
than the subject of the Reflex itself,
the regular modifier for the distance
to that subject is added to the longdistance modifier for the caster.

It is extravagant or even useless to cast
certain spells as Reflexed!

A Reflexed spell may be cast only
once. It then disappears, and no
longer counts as a spell on. The effects
are immediate, and the duration is
instantaneous, not the duration listed
for the original spell. This means that
it is extravagant or even useless to cast
certain spells as Reflexed! A Force
Dome, for example, would stop one
physical attack, then disappear – a
fatiguing, but effective, defense! A
Created Animal will appear, then disappear before it can make any action.
(It might stop a missile during its brief
existence, however. The GM may rule
such an animal must be nearly equal
in size to the target it is shielding.)
Exceptions to this instantaneousresult rule are spells with permanent
results, such as Major Healing – their
effects are indeed permanent.
Any person may carry any number
of Reflexes. However, only one spell
may be cast in any one turn.
Remember also, that if a Reflexed
spell is used as an active defense, no
other active defense may be used
against that attack, unless All-Out
Defense is chosen. See p. B366.
A Reflexed spell may be cast as a
regular action – it does not have to be
cast as a defense. It takes one second
to cast, regardless of the time it would
normally require to cast.
All normal modifiers for distance
and Magic Resistance are used when
casting the Reflexed spell, if the subject of the Reflexed spell is distant
from the person or object the Reflex
itself is cast on.

Example: Felix gives Beast-Soother
as a Reflexed spell to Rudolph. Felix
then activates a Wizard Eye to keep
tabs on Rudolph as he goes hunting.
Rudolph meets a short-tempered wild
boar, which Felix observes through
the Wizard Eye. Rudolph cannot activate the spell. Fortunately, he does not
have to! Felix activates Beast-Soother
as Rudolph tries an Animal Handling
roll to calm the boar. Rudolph has
gone about two miles into the woods,
so Felix is at -3 for long distance. The
boar is 3 yards away from Rudolph,
so Felix is at another -3 for the range
to the subject of the Reflexed spell. He
is also at -1 for having Wizard Eye on.
Thus, Felix casts Beast-Soother at -7,
and pays the energy for the spell at
that time. Fortunately he has it at
level 21, so he casts it for the maximum effect. The boar is indeed
calmed, and Rudolph goes on his way
while Felix rests. The Reflexed BeastSoother spell no longer exists. If
Rudolph meets another animal, he’s
on his own, though Felix may still be
observing any action with his Wizard
Eye.
Blocking spells and Missile spells
cannot be Reflexed; other spells can
be.
Duration: 1 hour.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Cost: Equal to the cost to cast the
subject spell – minimum of 1. Cost to
maintain is the same. Note that skill
with the Reflex spell does not affect
cost to cast it.
Prerequisites: Delay and Ward.

Encrypt
Regular
When cast on any writing or other
visual information medium, this spell
makes it unreadable to any but the
caster. Anyone can see the writing, but
they will be convinced that it is hopelessly arcane, complex, or foreign.
Other media dependent on the senses
(including any arcane taste- or smellbased “writing” that might be used by
nonhuman races, as well as Braille in
modern settings) may be encrypted if
the GM permits it.
Duration: 1 week.
Cost: 1 for up to 1000 words of
plaintext; 2 for up to 10,000 words of

plaintext; 3 for up to 100,000 words of
plaintext; +1 for each additional

(Move 1) while maintaining eye contact if he knows the spell at level 15 or
better; each yard he moves away from
the subject allows it another resistance roll to break the spell. The spell is
also broken by any attack (physical or
magical) on the subject.
Duration: Indefinite.
Cost: 4.
Prerequisite: Daze.

Item
Mirror, painting, or statuette.

Forgetfulness
Regular; Resisted by Will or skill
Causes the subject to forget one

two words – which the subject must
obey. If the subject is unable to fulfill
the command immediately or on his
next turn, the spell has no effect.
Examples:
“Drop it!” – the subject drops whatever he was holding.
“Look!” – the subject looks in the
direction the caster indicates.
“Wait!” – the subject takes the Wait
maneuver on his next turn.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisites:
Forgetfulness.

Item

Loyalty
Regular; Resisted by Will
Makes the subject loyal to the caster. The subject follows any direct order
the caster gives; in the absence of
direct orders, he acts in the caster’s
best interest as he understands it. The
spell is immediately broken if the caster attacks the subject. If the subject is
told to do something very hazardous
or against his normal code of behavior
(GM’s decision), he gets an IQ roll to
break the spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Double this cost if the subject does not
know the caster, or triple if the subject
is a foe of the caster.

some specific third person. (b) Staff or
wand. Usable only by mages; the item
must touch the subject. Energy cost to

Drunkenness
Regular; Resisted by Will
Makes the victim temporarily
intoxicated: he is loud, cheerful, and
badly coordinated. Both IQ and DX
are reduced by the amount of energy
put into the spell. If the victim is a PC,
he should be told he feels drunk, and
encouraged to roleplay it! When the
spell ends, it does so instantly (no
hangover).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 for each point of IQ and DX
lost (maximum 5). Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Foolishness and
Clumsiness.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the item
causes the effects of the Drunkenness
spell. Energy cost to create: 200 per point
of reduction. (b) Staff or wand. Usable
only by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 800.

Madness
Regular; Resisted by Will-2
The subject is driven temporarily
insane; this should be roleplayed. The
caster selects the severity of madness
he wishes to inflict, and the GM
decides which madness at that severity is appropriate to the situation
(rolling a die is a perfectly acceptable
way to make this decision). On a critical success, the caster may select the
madness to be inflicted.
Unless noted otherwise, each madness is identical to the disadvantage of
the same name. Some madnesses are
equivalent to disadvantages that
require self-control rolls. The subject
always fails his self-control rolls
against the magical madness.
Mild: Delusion [-5], Flashbacks
[-5], Phantom Voices [-5], Phobia [-5].
Moderate: Bestial [-10], Confused,
Delusion [-10], Flashbacks [-10],
Paranoia [-10], Phantom Voices [-10].
Severe: Berserk, Bestial [-15],
Chronic Depression, Delusion [-15],
Hallucinations (as the Hallucinating
incapacitating condition, p. B429),
Phantom Voices [-15].
Extreme: Catatonia (as the Daze
incapacitating condition (p. B428),
but the subject cannot snap out of it
until the spell ends), Flashbacks [-20].
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 for a Mild madness; 3 for
Moderate; 4 for Severe; 6 for Extreme.
Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Forgetfulness or
Drunkenness.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the item
causes the effects of the Madness
spell. When the item is created, the
caster can specify whether its effects
are gradual or immediate, and (if
desired) a specific type of madness.
Energy cost to create: 500. (b) Staff or
wand. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 1,000.


Lure
Area; Resisted by Will
Each being who steps within this spell’s area of effect feels compelled to approach the center of the affected region. The GM should roll the crea- ture’s resistance in secret and then tell the unlucky victim that he “feels curi- ous about the chest” or some such subtle hint. Once the victim has reached the center, he is immune to the spell until he leaves the affected area (if he returns, he will once again be “attacked” by the spell).
Lure and Avoid are antagonistic spells and thus resist each other.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1 to cast. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Emotion Control.

Emotion Control
Area; Resisted by Will
Instills the subject(s) with any one
emotion the caster chooses. There is no
“game system” effect unless the GM
feels it necessary, but subjects should
roleplay it! Some sample emotions:
love, hate, lust, anger, greed, jealousy,
hunger, fear, sadness, joy, peace, unrest,
depression, patriotism, boredom.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 2. Cannot be maintained;
spell must be recast.
Prerequisite: Loyalty or Mental
Stun.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the wearer is affected by the emotion instilled
in the item when it was created.
Energy cost to create: 300. (b) Staff or
wand. Usable only by mages; the item
must touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 1,000 for an item that can instill
only one emotion, or 2,200 for one
that instills any desired emotion.

Mindlessness (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Reduces the subject’s IQ to 1 temporarily, reducing him to babbling
idiocy. The subject cannot cast or
maintain spells, use skills, talk, or
other actions determined by the GM.
The subject can walk, laugh, cry,
drool, eat with his hands, react to heat
and cold, etc. He has a very short
attention span and notices only colors, pretty things, movement, and
other things that a baby would be
curious about. If the subject is a PC,
the player should roleplay this state.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 8 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Forgetfulness.

Item
Any item. The item casts
Mindlessness on its wearer. Energy
cost to create: 800.

Compel Lie
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject becomes unable to tell the truth: he cannot make any statement he believes to be true, and in fact feels compelled to tell lies, although he may (if he realizes that he is under a spell) choose to remain silent.
Compel Lie and Compel Truth resist each other. Aura may be required to find out which spell has won out! This is also a Communication and Empathy spell.
Duration: 5 minutes.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Emotion Control.


Mass Daze
Area; Resisted by HT
As Daze, but can be cast over an
area.

An area may be made permanently
attractive for 100 times normal energy
cost.

Mass Sleep
Area; Resisted by HT
As Sleep, but can be cast over an
area.
Base cost: 3. Minimum radius 2
yards.
Time to cast: 1 second for each
energy point spent.
Prerequisites: Sleep and IQ 13 or
higher.

Peaceful Sleep
Regular; Special Resistance
The subject gets an undisturbed
night’s sleep. This spell cures insomnia, allows sleep in noisy, disruptive
environments, and protects against
nightmares and the Nightmare spell.
This period counts double in terms of
HP and FP recovery. The caster can
awaken the subject with a word.
Otherwise, subject cannot be awakened, except by injury or with the
Awaken spell.
This spell works only on a willing
subject; otherwise, resistance is
automatic.
Duration: 8 hours.
Cost: 4.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Sleep and Silence.

Item
(a) Wand or staff that gives the
power to cast this spell. Energy cost to
create: 900. (b) Any item. If the wearer
is willing to sleep, the item puts him to
sleep as per the spell; he awakens in
eight hours, or if the item is removed.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Sickness
Regular; Resisted by HT
Makes the subject feel sick and
nauseated (dizzy, vomiting, etc.). He
may run if necessary (at half his normal Move) but may do nothing else
except maintain existing spells and
give very simple answers. When the
spell wears off, the sickness vanishes
instantly.
This is also a Body Control spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Drunkenness or Pestilence.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the item
causes effects of Sickness spell. Energy
cost to create: 300. (b) Staff or wand.
Usable only by mages; the item must
touch the subject. Energy cost to create:
1,500.

Will Lock
Area; Resisted by (ST+Will)/2
Creates a circular zone that traps
anyone inside at the moment of its
creation. The barrier is purely mental,
working on the wills of the people
trapped. For this reason, the subjects
must be aware they are being circled –
if they are not, the Will Lock has no
effect on them.
Each being trapped inside has one
chance to escape each day; roll a
Regular Contest between the being’s
(ST+Will)/2 and the Will Lock’s
Endurance (p. 10). Each being that
escapes weakens the Will Lock’s
Endurance by 1. Upon reaching
Endurance 0 or on a critical failure on
its part, the Will Lock dissipates. A
critical success by an escaping being
does not break the Will Lock. The spell
can also be broken if an outside party
scuffs the circles away.
The beings trapped can freely cast
spells or throw missiles across the Will
Lock’s boundary. An interesting
method of escape is to be knocked
unconscious and then thrown bodily
outside the Will Lock!
Duration: One day.
Base cost: 3 to cast. Cannot be
maintained; must be recast.
Time to cast: As long as it takes the
caster to circle the area three times
widdershins (counter-clockwise).
Prerequisite: Emotion Control.

The spell may otherwise be broken
only by Remove Curse.
Unknowing attempts, such as when
the subject is tricked into breaking his
oath, are not Resisted by the spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 4
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Emotion
Control.

Item
Jewelry. Always on; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 550.

Permanent Forgetfulness (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will or skill
As Forgetfulness, but permanent.
The subject also forgets he ever knew
that thing or that he was enchanted.
Another mage with this spell can
restore forgotten things by recasting
the spell and winning a Quick Contest
of Spells with the original Permanent
Forgetfulness spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 15.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Forgetfulness, and IQ 13 or higher.

Item
Any item. Same effect as for
Forgetfulness item, but if it is worn for
a full day, the thing is forgotten forever unless the spell is removed by
Remove Curse or an opposed
Permanent Forgetfulness spell. Energy
cost to create: 1,000.


Oath
Regular; Special Resistance
Similar to Great Geas, but works
on a willing subject only. Although the
caster casts the spell, the subject must
speak the oath.
The subject may knowingly
attempt to break his oath (rolling vs.
Will) no more than once per day. The
spell resists the attempt; if the subject
overcomes the resistance, he manages
to break the oath just this once. A critical success by the subject or a critical
failure by the spell breaks the spell.

Vigil (VH)
Regular
Skip a night’s sleep with no ill
effects. Each successive night’s casting
on the same subject is at a cumulative -3 to skill.
Duration: 1 night.
Cost: 8. Cannot be maintained, but
may be recast.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Sleep, and
Lend Energy. At the GM’s option,
“holy” status may be sufficient.

Item
Headgear or jewelry. Usable only
by a mage or (at the GM’s option) by
“holy” beings. Energy cost to create:
1,000. Rumors persist of an “alwayson” version.

Charm
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject becomes caster’s faithful slave until the spell expires, following any orders, no matter how dangerous. There is no mental link – the caster must give his orders to the subject
verbally or in writing. However, the
subject will protect the caster without
orders. In all other respects the subject
will be mentally normal and alert. He
will be unable to explain (and unwilling to discuss or even think about) his
loyalty to the caster.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Loyalty,
and seven other Mind Control spells.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the wearer becomes loyal to the original creator of the item (when that person
dies, the item loses its power). Energy
cost to create: 1,000. Double this cost
for an item that makes the wearer
loyal to some specific third person. (b)
Staff or wand. Usable only by mages;
the item must touch the subject.
Energy cost to create: 3,000.

Ecstasy (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject feels an incapacitating
rush of pleasure; he can take no action
for the duration, not even to move out
of harm’s way! High/Low Pain
Threshold is irrelevant.
Repeated exposure can be dangerous to the subject. If any character has
been the subject of an Ecstasy spell
three times within 10 days, he must
make a Will+2 roll after the third time,
and after each subsequent time until
five days pass without exposure to the
spell. If any of these rolls are failed,
the subject gains an Addiction (see
p. B122) to the spell, and will beg the
caster (or anyone else who is known to
have the spell) for more! Withdrawal
from the Ecstasy spell follows the normal rules for a psychological dependency (see Drug Withdrawal, p. B440).
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 6 to cast. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Emotion Control.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. Energy cost to create: 800. (b)
Headgear. Always on. The wearer may
not voluntarily remove the item, and
addiction occurs within 15 minutes.
Energy cost to create: 1,300.

Enthrall
Special; Resisted by Will
The caster tells an enthralling tale.
Anyone within earshot who knows the
language and pays attention falls under
the spell, resisting with Will. An hour of
real time passes, but the victims notice
only a minute slipping by. Anyone who
resists will perceive the caster and his
victims as paralyzed, although prolonged examination will reveal they are
moving, very slowly. Any subject that is
attacked or shaken breaks free of the
spell (in the latter case, the victim gets
an extra resistance roll for every second
that he’s disturbed).
This spell may never be higher
than the caster’s Public Speaking skill,
or Performance if the story is mimed
or acted out.
Duration: 1 hour (real time).
Cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Forgetfulness, Daze,
and Slow.

Item
Staff, comedian’s mask, or musical
instrument. Energy cost to create: 500.

Permanent Madness (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will-2
As for Madness, but permanent.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 20.
Time to cast: 10 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Madness,
and IQ 13 or higher.

False Memory
Regular; Resisted by Will
Insert a single, simple false memory into a subject’s mind. This spell is
often used to avoid paying bills, and is
considered highly illegal in many
areas.
If the implanted memory conflicts
with a real memory, the subject’s brain
will usually fit the new one in anyway,
leaving him slightly confused but convinced. In case of extreme direct conflict – “You remember killing the
duke” (when the subject saw the caster kill the duke!) – the subject should
be allowed a bonus on his resistance
roll; the example above would be a +5
for a loyal subject, but probably only
+1 for somebody who wanted to kill
the duke.
Duration: Variable (see below).
When the spell ends, the subject gets a
second resistance roll, at -1 for each
day the spell lasted. If this roll is failed,
the subject will believe the false memory indefinitely, but is likely to remember the truth at some unpredictable
time, perhaps as a result of a shock.
Cost: 3 for a duration of an hour, or
8 for a whole day. Cost to maintain is
3 per hour if cast for an hour, or 4 per
day if cast for a day.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Forgetfulness and six
other Mind Control spells.

Item
Any item. Always on; the item
causes the wearer to remember one
false memory specified when the item
is created. The wearer will forget the
memory one hour after the item is
removed. Energy cost to create: 500.

Avoid
Area
Makes the subject area unattractive
to all creatures except the caster. Gazes
will be averted, and approaching characters will feel an intense unease, an
urge to be somewhere else. The spell
resists attempts to look at it or to
approach it (roll caster’s skill vs.
searcher’s Will). Victims won’t be aware
of the repulsion if it can act in a subtle
way (e.g., you just felt like sitting in
front rather than in the middle . . .).
This is a subtle spell, and GMs should
roll in secret to see if it works. If it does,
the victims should not be told “You
can’t look in that closet,” but just “you
see nothing.” The spell made them
think they had checked the closet, or
made each searcher think that another
one had checked it . . . and so on.
If a single caster uses both Hide
and Avoid, the GM should not check
for the results of the Hide spell unless
a searcher penetrates the Avoid spell
and looks in the caster’s direction.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 3 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Hide, Fear, and
Forgetfulness.

Item
An area can be made permanently
“avoided” at an energy cost of 100
times normal.

Nightmare
Regular; Resisted by Will
When cast on a sleeping subject,
this spell causes a nightmare of the
caster’s choice. Knowledge of the subject’s fears and phobias gives a +2 to
effective skill. The subject gets an IQ-4
roll to realize the nightmare was
caused by hostile magic. If the spell
succeeds, the subject gets no rest from
the night’s sleep, and instead loses 2
FP. Dispel Magic will stop the nightmare while it is occurring, preventing
FP loss. This spell is also countered by
the Peaceful Sleep spell.
If the spell is recast the next night,
the effects are cumulative. If the subject’s FP falls to zero due to this spell,
he falls into a coma and will lose 1d
HP each day until he dies, unless
Dispel Magic is cast.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 6.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Death
Vision, Fear, and Sleep.

Item
(a) Wand or staff that gives the
power to cast this spell. Energy cost to
create: 800. (b) Any item. If the item is
worn for more than eight hours a day,
it causes a nightmare as per the spell,
even if taken off at night! Energy cost
to create: 500.

Hallucination
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject’s perceptions are
addled. He is completely convinced
that one thing that is not present is (or
vice versa); he can see it, hear it, feel it,
and so on. This is similar to an illusion
in some ways, but it exists entirely in
the mind of the subject.
The hallucination must concern
the presence or absence of a single
“thing”: one person the subject knows
or knew, one crowd of revelers, one
pair of shackles on the subject’s wrists,
one pride of lions . . . If it can be
described as a single entity in English
(without amazing gymnastics), then it
should pass. The GM’s judgment is
final, as usual.
The hallucination does not require
concentration: the subject supplies,
unconsciously, all the “realism” necessary. By concentrating, the caster can
“direct” the hallucination – put words
in the mouth of the absent person,
have the revelers head off in a certain
direction or start singing a particular
song, etc.
Impossible or obviously false hallucinations (a long-dead uncle, for
example) are Resisted at a bonus of up
to +5.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Madness and Suggestion.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; the item
causes the effects of Hallucination
spell. When the item is created, the
caster must specify the nature of the
hallucination. Energy cost to create:
1,000. (b) Staff or wand. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,200.

Lesser Geas (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Give a subject one command, which
the subject must obey. This must be a
command to do one specific thing. It
must be reasonably possible, in the
GM’s opinion. “Destroy every tree on
this continent” is not a legal geas (at
least in a low-tech world). Until the geas
is fulfilled or removed (only Remove
Curse will do this), the subject must
make it his first priority.
Duration: Permanent until fulfilled.
Cost: 12.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
10 Mind Control spells, including
Command.

Item
Any item. Always on; the item
places a Lesser Geas (specified at the
time of its creation) on the wearer. The
wearer may not voluntarily remove
the item; if it is removed anyway, the
geas will persist for a month unless
removed by Remove Curse. Energy
cost to create: 2,000.

Suggestion
Regular; Resisted by Will
Instills a suggestion in the subject’s
mind. It must be one simple idea; language is no barrier unless the subject’s
language cannot encompass the idea.
If the suggestion goes against the subject’s personal safety, it is Resisted at
+5; if it goes against his beliefs, convictions or knowledge, it is Resisted at
+3. The subject will try to accomplish
the suggestion or otherwise act as if
the idea was his own.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Emotion Control and
Forgetfulness.

Item
Any. Always on; the item causes
wearer to have one idea, specified when
the object was created. The suggestion
dissipates an hour after the object is
removed. Cost to create: 400 energy. (b)
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject.
Cost to create: 500 energy.

Mass Suggestion
Area; Resisted by Will
As Suggestion, but affects an area
and all those within it with a single
suggestion.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Base cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain
(minimum radius is 2 yards).
Time to cast: 1 second per energy
point.
Prerequisite: Suggestion.

Item
Musical instrument. The user must
be skilled in it (use the lower of spell
and musical skills). Energy cost to
create: 1,500 energy.

Glib Tongue
Regular; Resisted by Will
The caster can mystically make
anything he says be what the subject
wants to hear. Whatever the caster
says, even total gibberish, will find
hearty agreement. However, the caster
won’t have a clue what the target
thinks he’s saying . . . GMs may give up
to +3 on reaction rolls, depending on
how cleverly the PC roleplays this.
Duration: 5 minutes.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Suggestion.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 650.

Enslave (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like the Charm spell, but permanent. The subject will follow the caster’s orders until the spell ends or is
removed. At any time the caster concentrates, he can form a mental link
with the subject to see through the
subject’s eyes, hear through his ears,
and give orders.

Cost: 30.
Prerequisites: Charm and Telepathy.

Great Hallucination (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Hallucination, but the subject’s
entire environment can be falsified. He
might see himself stranded on a cliff
side, in a crowded city street, in the
middle of a lake, etc. The only limits are
the fiendishness of the caster’s imagination and the judgment of the GM.
For any significant changes to
occur in the subject’s new surroundings, concentration on the part of the
caster
is
required,
as
per
Hallucination. If the caster dramatically changes the subject’s perceptions, the subject may be given a new
resistance roll, at the GMs option.
Example: the subject is “placed” on
top of a giant pillar of stone over a lake
of molten lava. By concentrating, the
caster could cause the pillar to begin
sinking or bucking beneath the subject’s feet, or cause a flying monster to
appear. If the caster suddenly decided
that the lava turned into a green
meadow, however, the subject would
get a new Resistance roll.
This spell can be used for positive
effect; if the subject is required to walk
a narrow log across a thousand-footdeep chasm, he might find it easier if
the log spans only a shallow
streambed . . .

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Hallucination.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on; only
affects the wearer. When the item is
created, the caster must specify the
nature of the hallucination. Energy
cost to create: 2,500. (b) Staff or wand.
Usable only by mages. Energy cost to
create: 900.

Great Geas (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Give a subject one continuing command, such as “Never touch weapons”
or “Slay all orcs.” A Great Geas does not
have to be reasonably possible; it can
occupy the subject for the rest of his life
unless removed. Only Remove Curse
will negate a geas. A critical failure on a
Great Geas costs the caster an IQ point.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 30.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and at least
15 Mind Control spells, including
Lesser Geas.

Item
Any item. Always on; the item places
a Great Geas (specified at time of its
creation) on its wearer. The wearer may
not voluntarily remove the item; if it is
removed, the geas will persist for a year
unless removed by Remove Curse.
Energy cost to create: 4,000.


Haste
Regular
Increases the subject’s Move and
Dodge scores by up to 3.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast per point added to
the subject’s Move and Dodge. Half
that to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.

Item
Shoes or jewelry. Only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 250 for
every point added to Move score.

Apportation
Regular; Resisted by Will
Move physical objects without
touching them. This spell levitates its
subject at Move 1 – not fast enough to
do damage with it. Living subjects get
to resist with Will.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Varies with the weight of the
object. Cost to maintain is the same.
Weight
Energy                      Cost
less than 1 pound           1
up to 10 pounds             2
up to 50 pounds             3
up to 200 pounds            4
every additional 100 pounds +4
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch or point at
the subject. Energy cost to create: 900.

Glue
Area
Makes a surface extremely sticky,
trapping anyone stepping onto the
surface as if by a Rooted Feet spell
(p. 36). If a victim successfully resists,
he is free to act until he moves more
than a yard from his original position,
at which point he becomes stuck
again if he is still in the Glue area.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Base cost: 3 to cast. Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Haste.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 900 energy. (b) An area
may be made permanently sticky for
100 times the normal casting cost.

Grease
Area
Makes a surface extremely slippery.
Anyone stepping onto the surface
must roll against DX-2 for every yard
he moves within the affected area. If
he fails the roll, he falls down. Another
DX-2 roll is necessary to stand up (but
not to sit or kneel). All close combat,
melee attacks, and active defenses are
at -3; other physical skills, including
missile and thrown weapon attacks,
are at -2 for bad footing. This spell can
also be cast on vertical surfaces to
make climbing impossible. The GM
will have to use his judgment with surfaces of intermediate tilt.
Unlike Ice Slick, whose effects are
nearly identical, Grease cannot be seen
by normal means. Also, crampon boots
are ineffectual against a Greased surface. Grease and Glue resist each other.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Base cost: 3 to cast. Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Haste.

Increase Burden
Regular; Special Resistance
Increases the weight of an object;
the object’s wearer (if such is the case)
resists using Will. Useful to slow down
a charging knight or to keep things
from being blown away by the wind.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 1 per 25 pounds original
weight (or fraction) to double, twice
that to triple it and twice again to
quadruple it. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Apportation.


Lighten Burden
Regular
Reduces the weight of any
equipment the subject is carrying.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 3 for 25% reduction; 5 for
50% reduction. Half that (round up) to
maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Apportation.





Jump
Regular
Improves the subject’s ability to
jump, increasing his Basic Move for
jumping purposes only.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 to 3 to cast. Cannot be
maintained. The increase in the subject’s Basic Move is equal to twice the
energy put into the spell.
Prerequisite: Apportation.


Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 700. (b) An area may be
made permanently slippery for 100
times the normal casting cost.

Item

Deflect Missile
Blocking
Deflects one missile about to hit the
subject – including any Missile spell.
Counts as a parry for combat purposes. If the caster is not the subject,
apply distance modifiers as for a
Regular spell. Deflected attacks may
still hit a target beyond the subject.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Apportation.

Hold Fast
Blocking
This spell negates knockback from
any source.
Cost: 1 for every yard of knockback
nullified.
Prerequisite: Apportation.

Item
Footwear or jewelry. The item must
bear a picture of an ox or an oak tree.
Always on. Energy cost to create: 300.

Staff, jewelry, or footwear. The item
must bear a picture of a grasshopper,
rabbit, or deer. Energy cost to create:
250 per point of Jumping bonus the
item can give (maximum 6).

Levitation
Regular; Resisted by ST or Will
Subject must be a living being. The
subject floats through the air, moving
as the caster wills. Moving a levitating
subject requires Concentration unless
the caster is the subject. Leaving a subject suspended in midair requires no
concentration. Maximum Move for a
levitated being is 3, horizontally or vertically. A caster who levitates uses DXbased skills normally; other subjects
use them at -3.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 per 80 pounds (minimum 2)
to cast. Half (round up) to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Apportation.

Item
A backpack that reduces the weight
of equipment held in it. Energy cost to
create: 300 for 25% reduction; 600 for
50% reduction.

Locksmith
Regular
Allows fine manipulation of small
parts – e.g., the inside of a lock. Adds 5
to the subject’s Lockpicking skill by
letting him move tumblers, etc., without touching them, if he has normal
tools available. Lets a wizard with no
tools at all attempt to open a lock at
his normal Lockpicking skill. Gives a
similar bonus for Mechanic and other
skills where a “third hand” is useful.
Duration: 1 minute. (One minute
allows one attempt at the average
lock.) Once open, a lock stays open
until closed.
Cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Apportation.

Item
A golden key, or a golden amulet in
the shape of a key. Its intrinsic value
must be at least $300. Energy cost to
create: 1,000.

Long March
Regular; Resisted by ST
Halves the subject’s long-distance
travel rate (p. B351). It does not affect
the combat Move rate or Basic Speed.
Duration: 1 day.
Cost: 3 to cast. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and either
Clumsiness or Debility.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 800.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
400. (b) Footwear. The item must bear
a picture of a snail. Always on; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 300.

Poltergeist
Missile; Resisted by HT
Hurls the subject at caster’s chosen
target. The effect is as if a man with ST
15 threw the subject (see Throwing,
p. B355). When it strikes something, it
does crushing damage. A DX-4 or
Throwing skill roll is necessary to hit
the target, who may dodge or block
normally. Note that only the subject of
the spell – not the target – can resist!
1⁄2D 20, Max 60, Acc 1. Figure distance to the target from either the
caster or the thing being thrown,
whichever starts out farther away.

Item
Clothing or jewelry. Energy cost to
create: 1,000.

Wallwalker
Regular
Walk on walls or ceilings as if they
were level ground. The subject must
keep at least one hand or foot in contact with the surface; otherwise, the
spell is broken. Combat is at -2 for
both the wallwalker and his foe
because of weird angles.

Cost: 1 point for an item up to 10
pounds (1d damage); 2 points for
something up to 25 pounds (1d+1
damage).
Prerequisite: Apportation.


Item

Jewelry or shoes. The item must
bear a picture of a spider, fly, or lizard.
Only affects the wearer. Cost to create:
1,000 energy.

Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must point at the subject and then at the target. Energy cost
to create: 1,000.

Dancing Object
Regular
Animates a single object to do repetitive work. It can accomplish roughly the same sorts of tasks as a ST 15 man: a bucket could carry water from a stream to a barrel, a broom could sweep a building over and over again, a crossbow could cock itself, etc. The object’s program cannot be changed or respond to events . . . it just does its work, mindlessly. The clever use of Link can make Dancing Objects effectively respond to situations, but this requires some careful thought.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Apportation.


Quick March
Regular
Doubles the subject’s long-distance
travel speed. At the end of the day’s
travel, the subject loses 10 FP and
must sleep. This spell has no effect on
Move in combat or on Basic Speed.
Duration: 1 day’s march.
Cost: 4. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Haste.

Item
Footwear or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 400.

Slow Fall
Regular
Slows the velocity of a falling subject to 1 yard per second. No damage
will be suffered upon landing on a
normal surface (spikes, etc. would still
do half damage). This spell can be cast
before the subject becomes airborne.
If the subject is already falling, he/it
will fall another 10 feet (assuming
standard gravity of 1G) in the second
normally required to cast this spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 per 50 pounds of weight.
Half that to maintain.
Prerequisite: Apportation.

Item

Distant Blow
Regular
Attacks a subject at a distance. The
caster chooses a single melee weapon
that, for the duration of the spell,
gains infinite reach with regard to the
subject only. The weapon must be one
that delivers blows – brass knuckles
are all right, but a garrote is not! As
long as the subject is within the caster’s line of sight, the caster’s weapon
can strike him. The subject defends
normally (dodge, block, parry), as if
an invisible double of the caster was
engaging him.
The caster’s own body (for punching, biting, and kicking) counts as one
weapon for purposes of this spell. If
the subject gets inside the weapon’s
real Reach, normal rules apply.
The weapon does not actually
stretch or leap from the caster’s hand;
the force of the blow is transmitted
magically. Apply standard ranged
attack modifiers (p. B548) to the
caster’s attacks.
Note that magical properties of the
weapon (e.g., Flaming Weapon) or the
caster (e.g., Melee spells) cannot be
used through this spell!
Duration: 5 seconds.
Cost: 3. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Apportation.

Item
Staff or other weapon. Energy cost
to create: 1,000 per pound of the
weapon’s weight (minimum 1 pound).

Lockmaster
Regular; Resisted by Magelock
Opens locks magically. A Magelock
spell gets a roll to resist Lockmaster.
Any modifiers for the difficulty of the
lock that would apply to Lockpicking
skill also affect this spell.
Duration: Once opened, a lock
stays open until closed.
Cost: 3. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Either Magery 2 and
Apportation or Locksmith.

Item
A platinum key, or a platinum
amulet in the shape of a key. Its intrinsic value must be at least $800. Energy
cost to create: 2,000.

Manipulate
Regular
Allows manipulation of items larger
than allowed by the Locksmith spell.
Ropes may be untied, doorknobs
turned, knives sharpened, handmill
cranks turned, etc. The caster need not
touch the subject. Any activity complex
enough to require a DX penalty gives
the same penalty to this spell.
Duration: 1 minute. (This allows
untying the average knot.)
Cost: 4 to cast and 3 to maintain for
each 10 pounds manipulated.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Locksmith.

Item
Wand, staff, or glove. Energy cost to
create: 600.

Slow
Regular; Resisted by HT
Slows down the subject a great
deal; in effect, the subject has one
level of Decreased Time Rate for the
duration of the spell.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 5 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Haste, and
Hinder.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b)
Footwear or jewelry. Always on.
Energy cost to create: 500.

Undo
Regular; Special Resistance
Unties knots and fastenings of any
kind that could normally be undone
by hand (but not locks). A critical success would even undo chain mail into
its component links! Useful to surreptitiously rob someone of earrings,
necklaces, etc. Will unstring bows,
unbutton shirts, unlace bodices,
unbuckle belts . . .
Cost: 3 for a single fastening, one
more for each extra target within one
yard; 6 will undo everything in a oneyard radius, but a person in that area
resists with their Will.
Heavier items may be undone at a
proportional cost. For instance, if a
mage is chained, he might want to
Undo a link of the chain, bending it
open. The GM rules that it would take
ST 20 (twice normal strength) to open
a link by hand. So the cost to Undo
that link is twice normal, or 6.
Prerequisite: Locksmith.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or glove. Only affects
the wearer; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 400. (b)
Amulet granting immunity from the
Undo spell. Energy cost to create: 40.

Winged Knife
Missile
Magically throw any weapon. The
weapon is the “subject” for distance
purposes when determining whether
the spell succeeds. 1⁄2D 20, Max 40,
Acc 1. If it hits, it does the damage it
would do if hurled by a man of ST 15.
Basic thrusting damage for that ST is
1d+1; basic swing damage is 2d+1.
Cost: 1 per pound of weapon’s
weight. Double cost for a weapon that
is not normally thrown (such as a
broadsword).
Prerequisite: Poltergeist.

Item
Any weapon. At holder’s command,
the weapon will leap from his hand, or
from its scabbard, to fly at a target.
This is considered an attack maneuver, carried out with DX equal to the
item’s power. Energy cost to create: 300
per pound of weapon’s weight –
minimum cost 300.

Flight (VH)
Regular
Fly through the air under your own
control, without wings, at Move 10.
Flight speed is reduced normally by
encumbrance. A flying character can
move and fight normally, and has a
combat advantage if above his foes
(p. B402).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Levitation.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 2,500.

Light Tread
Regular
Walk on any surface (which must
be able to bear his weight) without
leaving any trace, making tracking
impossible. If vegetation is present on
the surface, some traces of the subject
will remain, making tracking possible
at a -8 penalty. This spell will also
prevent the subject from triggering
pressure-plate traps and the like.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 4 to cast. 1 to maintain. If the
caster also knows Hide Path, an extra
point of energy to cast and maintain
will ensure that even vegetation won’t
bear any trace of the subject’s passage.
Prerequisites: Apportation and
Shape Earth.

Item
Footwear; the item must bear a
picture of a doe. Only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 400.

Slide
Regular; Resisted by Will
Slide down a slope as if skiing. The
subject uses the Skiing skill, at default
if necessary; assess a -2 penalty for not
having poles to guide oneself with.
The spell works equally well on all
types of surfaces (sand, grass, stone
. . . ), but the subject still has to avoid
any obstacles!
Down a good slope, the subject can
sustain a Move equal to the subject’s
Skiing skill can be sustained relatively
safely. Peak Move, in extremely good
conditions, equals twice his Skiing skill.
On level ground, the spell is a nuisance; the subject is constantly affected as if he has just entered a Greased
area!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisites: Apportation and
Grease.

Item
Jewelry or footwear. The item must
bear a picture of an otter. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 350.

Flying Carpet (VH)
Regular
Transforms a carpet (or any other
object one could reasonably stand on
or in – cauldron, chair, towel, broom,
etc.) into a flying vehicle. It is under
the command of the first person to
step aboard it. If there are several
beings already aboard when the spell is
cast, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see
who gets control; the caster (if aboard)
gets a +5 bonus to this roll. If the pilot
leaves the carpet, roll another quick
contest of Will between the remaining
passengers to see who gets control.
The carpet’s maximum Move is
equal to the caster’s effective skill, and
it can handle 1 G turns without skill
rolls being necessary (p. B466). Use
the Piloting (Contragravity) skill
(p. B214) to control the carpet.
In general, a rider cannot fall from
a flying carpet unless he jumps off
deliberately or is knocked off by an
obstacle (such as a tree branch) or
attack; the carpet keeps its riders safely on board through a combination of
magic and deft maneuvering. A flying
carpet does not bank sharply, fold, or
bend; the spell specifically provides a
stable, level platform (which makes
flying through narrow gaps rather
hard). Any rider engaged in strenuous
activity such as fighting must make a
DX roll every turn to avoid falling off
(the GM may modify this roll depending on the activity). In all other
respects, treat anyone fighting from a
flying carpet as being on the ground
(ignore the special rules for flying
combatants on p. B548). Characters
aiming a missile weapon from a moving carpet can only take the Acc
bonus; aiming for extra turns gives no
further bonus. Of course, someone
fighting from a flying broom or chair
would be subject to the usual penalties
for being seated (p. B547)
Generous GMs may stipulate that,
after the caster cancels the spell, the
conveyance remains airborne for 2d+2
seconds, wobbling more with every
passing moment. This sometimes
allows a safe, if bumpy, landing.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 1 per square foot of surface.
Each square foot will carry about 25
pounds (or less, of made of flimsy
material). Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Either Magery 2 and
Walk on Air or Flight.

Hawk Flight (VH)
Regular
A very fast Flight spell. The subject has a Move of 40 (80 mph) without encumbrance; encumbrance
reduces Move normally. The subject
can move and fight normally, and has
a combat advantage if above his foes
(p. B402).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 8 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Flight.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 3,000.


Ethereal Body (VH)
Regular
The subject becomes ethereal and
can move through solid objects and
creatures as if they were not there.
His clothes become ethereal, but not
his equipment. He cannot wield
weapons or move things about, and
does not need to breathe, eat, or drink
while ethereal. He has, in most
respects, become a ghost. He can be
seen, though he has a translucent
appearance, and can be heard if he
speaks.
Physical attacks and most magic
cannot affect someone who is ethereal. However, any spell of the Colleges
of Communication and Empathy or
Mind Control has normal effect on an
ethereal person, and is Resisted at -2!
Likewise, Necromantic spells affecting
the mind or soul will have normal
effect and be Resisted at -2.
Ethereal individuals can use
magic, but at a -5 to skill; the ethereal
plane appears to be a low-mana area.
Ethereal bodies can interpenetrate,
and cannot harm each other except with spells, as above.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 8 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and either Body of Air or six Movement spells.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, jewelry, or cape;
only affects the wearer. A severe drawback is that, with the exception of the
cape, the item falls through the caster
as soon as the spell is cast! Energy cost
to create: 3,000 (8,000 for the cape). (b)
Gem that glows and vibrates when
any ethereal being is within 50 yards.
Cost to create: A gem worth $500, and
100 energy.

Great Haste (VH)
Regular
Speeds the subject up a lot. In
effect, the subject has one level of
Altered Time Rate (p. B38) for the
duration of the spell.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 5. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast. At the spell’s end, the
subject also loses 5 FP (unless the caster was the subject).
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, IQ 12 or
higher, and Haste.

Item
Shoes or jewelry; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 2,000.
The item costs the wearer 5 FP for
each 10 seconds of effect.

Pull
Regular
When cast on a single point, this
creates a zone of “attraction.” Objects
(including living beings) are pulled to
the center point at Move 1 by a force
that increases as one gets closer to it.
Living beings can “resist” with a Quick
Contest of ST every second. The pull
has a ST equal to twice the energy put
into the spell at the center, reduced by
1 for every yard of distance. The spell
does not have any effect on objects
heavier than 20 times its ST. Note that,
to drag an ordinary human being
(weight 150 pounds) along an ordinary floor, the spell would have to
have a ST of at least 8.
This spell can only be cast on a
point in space or on the ground, not on
objects or creatures. A small pile of
loose objects, dust, dead leaves, small
insects, etc, usually forms at the center.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 for every 2 ST of “pull.”
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
four Movement spells including
Levitation.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
250. (b) An area may be made permanently attracting for 100 times casting
cost.

Repel
Regular
Like Pull, except that the force now
repels objects instead of attracting
them.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 per 2 ST worth of “repulsion” at the center point.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and at least
four Movement spells including
Levitation.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
250. (b) An area may be made permanently repelling for 100 times casting
cost.

Swim
Regular
Move through water at normal
Move (reduced normally for encumbrance). The subject is in full control
of his own movement, and can act and
fight without the normal penalties for
underwater combat. This spell does
not provide for the subject’s breathing
needs! However, the subject automatically makes all Swimming rolls,
regardless of fatigue or encumbrance,
unless he is actually dragged totally
under the water.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Shape Water and
Levitation.

Item
Staff, wand, jewelry, or cape. The
item must bear a picture of a sleek
fish. Only affects the wearer. Cost to
create: 1,000 energy.

Teleport (VH)
Special
Instantly moves the caster to
another location. However, the farther
away the target spot is, the more energy is required, and the greater is the
skill penalty, as follows:
Normally, you may only teleport to
a place you are looking at or one you
are familiar with. Penalties: -2 for a
place you have “seen” only through
the mind or memories of another, or
via television; -2 for a place you have
not seen within a month (except, perhaps, your own home!); and -1 to -3
for a place seen only briefly.
This spell is dangerous, too. If you
fail your roll by 1, you take 1d damage
and arrive at your destination physically stunned (HT roll to recover). If
you miss your roll by more than 1, you
suffer no physical injury – but you go
somewhere else. The location is up to
the GM! A critical failure with this
spell can send the caster anywhere the
GM likes – make it interesting! – and
cause physical injury, as long as it
doesn’t kill the caster outright.
Even a successful teleport can be
confusing. A wizard must roll vs. his
Body Sense skill (p. B181) in order to
act on the same turn in which he teleports. A failed roll means disorientation – no actions except defense are
possible on that turn. A critical failure
means he falls down, physically
stunned. A teleporter arrives in the
same position he started in. He may
be facing a different direction, but this
makes it more likely that he will be disoriented on arrival: -2 to change
facing, -5 to go from vertical to
horizontal or vice versa!
Anything carried on your person,
up to “heavy” encumbrance, goes with
you. You can also take one person with
you by holding hands, if the added
weight does not exceed your “heavy”
encumbrance limit. On a failed roll,
they suffer the same effects you do.
This is also a Gate spell.

x10 distance             +1        -1

Prerequisites: Either IQ 13 or better
and at least one spell from 10 different
colleges, or Hawk Flight.

Item
Staff or wand; usable only by
mages. Energy cost to create: 3,000. An
item that will only take the user to
one, predetermined place costs 2,000
to create; the caster must be very
familiar with that place.

Teleport Other (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will+1
Same as Teleport, except that the
caster does not move, and the subject
can be anything or anyone. A part of
an object may not be teleported
away; neither may a solid object be
teleported into another solid object.
Separating two connected objects carries a penalty set by the GM; taking
the stopper from a jar might be at -1,
while teleporting a locked door from
its frame might be a -5. Jewelry or
clothing being worn, or an object held
tightly by another person, is at -5 to
teleport away, and the holder may
attempt a resistance roll.
This is also a Gate spell.
Cost: Costs and skill penalties are
as for Teleport, with the following
multipliers:
Weight                 Multiplier
less than 10 pounds    x1/2
10-49 pounds           x1
50-99 pounds           x2
100-200 pounds         x3
One additional multiple for
each 100 pounds thereafter.
The consequences of a missed roll
are similar, but inanimate objects are
less likely to suffer physical damage. If
a sapient subject resists the roll, the
caster suffers no ill effects other than
the expenditure of energy.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and Teleport.

Item
Staff or wand; usable only by
mages. The user must point it first at
the subject and then towards the
desired destination; this takes a second and cannot be hurried. Energy
cost to create: 3,000.

Blink
Blocking
Avoid an attack by teleporting
instantly out of its way and into an
open spot nearby. A spot is not open if
someone is standing in it; any lesser
obstruction is “open” for the purpose
of this spell.
The caster may Blink to any unoccupied spot within 3 yards, in any direction. The caster’s facing remains
unchanged. The caster must roll against
his Body Sense skill to act on his next
turn (p. B181). If there are no open
spots within 3 yards, the spell will fail.
For combat purposes, the “blink”
is treated as a dodge that succeeds
automatically if the spell roll is made.
A critical failure on this spell is
treated like a Teleport critical failure,
except that the caster rarely goes more
than a mile.
This is also a Gate spell.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Teleport.

Item
Clothing or jewelry. Energy cost to
create: 800.

Blink Other (VH)
Blocking
As Blink, but usable on others.
This is also a Gate spell.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Blink.

Freedom
Regular
Bestows a bonus on the subject’s use
of skills or attributes to maintain or
regain his freedom of movement.
Typical cases include: Contests of DX or
ST to avoid being grappled, to break
free, or to evade; using Escape or
Lockpicking; jumping or climbing
restraining walls; bending bars apart or
forcing doors; resisting Glue,
Levitation, or Paralysis spells, and so
on.
The spell does not help with
Camouflage, Disguise, or Stealth;
Mind Control spells; dodging missiles;
using Lockpicking, Climbing, or
Jumping to get inside some place, and
so on. The GM’s judgment is final.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 per point of bonus
(maximum bonus +5). Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisites: At least three spells
from each of the Body Control,
Movement, and Protection and
Warning colleges.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,600.

Jewelry or clothing. Always on. The
wearer becomes very hard to hold,
keep in chains, or behind bars . . . A
rare item! Energy cost to create: 500
per point of bonus.

Item
Staff, wand, jewelry, or shoes. The
jewelry and shoes only affect their
wearers. Energy cost to create: 500.

Cloud-Vaulting (VH)
Regular
Travel great distances with a few
movements. The subject flips into the
sky and bounces to his destination
using clouds like trampolines. CloudVaulting can only be cast in open air.
Each casting of this spell carries
the subject up to 100 miles, plus 100
miles per skill level above DX in
Acrobatics. If there are no clouds at all
in the sky (a frequent occurrence over
deserts), the subject cannot go farther
than 100 miles. Storms will likewise
block the subject’s path. An Acrobatics
roll is required every 100 miles, at a
penalty equal to the subject’s encumbrance level. On a failure, the subject
falls 3d¥3 yards (p. B431) and lands at
a random location along the intended
path – Slow Fall will save the subject
from damage, but the Cloud-Vaulting
spell is still broken.
This is a dizzying spell; upon arriving at his destination (or failing his
Acrobatics roll), the subject will be
physically stunned unless he can roll
his Body Sense (p. B181) skill at -1 per
100 miles covered.
This is also a Weather spell.
Duration: 1 second per 100 miles.
Cost: 7 to cast. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Jump, and
Walk on Air.

Item

Cloud-Walking
Regular
Walk on clouds (including fog
banks) as though they were solid. If the
subject falls for any reason (e.g., injury),
the spell is broken! If the spell is recast
immediately, the subject will fall for
only one second (about 5 yards); if he is
still in the midst of the cloud, he’ll have
to “dig” his way out, which will take
about 5 seconds. If he is already
through the cloud deck, too bad!
This is also a Weather spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Walk on Air and Walk
on Water.

(a) Footwear. The item must bear a
cloud design. Energy cost to create:
4,000. (b) Jewelry, wand, or staff.
Usable only by mages. Energy cost to
create: 3,000.

Death Vision
Regular
The subject sees a vivid apparition
of his own death. This might be a vision
of the future or a false vision from
another possible
future – but it is
always chilling.
The subject is
mentally
stunned until
he can make
his IQ roll to
shake off the
effects of the
spell. This
spell can also
be useful to
the subject, by
pointing out a
possibly deadly
hazard.

Duration:
1 second.
Cost: 2.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 600.

Sense Spirit
Information; Area
Find any ghosts, spirits, undead, or
similar supernatural entities within
the area of effect. On a good roll, it
gives a general impression of what
kind of being is present. The caster
may, at the time of casting, limit the
spell to a specific type of entity, or
exclude a given type.
Base cost: 1/2 (minimum 1).
Prerequisites: Either Magery 1 and
Sense Life or Death Vision.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 100. (b) Gem that glows
or vibrates when spirits are within its
detection radius. Energy cost to create:
100 for a 1-yard detection radius, 200
for a 2-yard radius, and so on.


Summon Spirit
Information; Resisted by spirit’s Will
Talk to the spirit of a dead person.
The subject resists at -5 if he was a
friend of the caster. If the spell succeeds, the subject will answer one
question, to the best of his knowledge
as of the time he died, and one more
per minute he remains.
If the spell fails, that caster (or ceremonial group) may not summon that
spirit again for one year. A critical failure means the caster summoned a
malign spirit, who lies deliberately.
Modifiers: -5 if you don’t know the
subject’s full name. -1 if it has been
more than a week since the subject’s
death, -2 if more than a month, -3 if
more than a year, -4 if more than 10
years, -5 if more than 50 years, and -6
if more than 500 years.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 20 to cast. 10 to maintain.
Halve these costs if the spell is cast at
the site of death or over the corpse of
the person being contacted; quarter
these costs if both conditions are met.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Death
Vision.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. The item does not give the
ability to cast the spell, but gives +2 to
skill. Energy cost: 1,000.

Animation (VH)
Regular
Summon a spirit (IQ 9) to animate
an existing statue, painting, or other
item. The object that is animated must
depict or represent a human or animal. Its abilities and attributes depend
on its body. This is entirely up to the
GM– for instance, a painting could
talk, but not move around while a statue might leave its base and move
freely. Within its limitations, the animated object will follow the caster’s
verbal orders; it has no judgment and
will carry out its orders precisely.
Unlike a golem (p. 59), it cannot be
instructed to follow another person’s
orders.

Skull-Spirits
A skull-spirit is a ghostly, vaporous form, created from the life force
that lingers around a sapient being’s skull. Skull-spirits obey the being
who evoked them without question. They cannot be reasoned with, but
can sometimes be confused.

Steal Energy
Regular
Take FP from the subject to restore
your own lost fatigue. The subject must
either be willing or totally helpless (e.g.,
bound or unconscious). The caster
must touch the subject. This works on
living, sapient subjects only! The spell
stops when the caster’s FP is fully
restored, when the caster decides to
stop, or when the subject’s FP reaches 0
and the subject falls unconscious.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: None to the caster! For every
3 FP taken from the subject, the caster regains 1 FP.
Time to cast: 1 minute for every 3
FP drained from the subject.
Prerequisite: Minor Healing.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. The wearer
and the item must both touch the
victim. Energy cost to create: 800.

Steal Vitality
Regular
Take HP from the subject to heal
your own injuries. The subject must
either be willing or totally helpless; the
caster must touch the subject. This
works on living, sapient subjects only!
The spell stops when the caster’s HP is
fully restored, when the caster decides
to stop, or when the subject’s HP
reaches -1 (which automatically kills
the subject).
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: None to the caster! For every
3 HP taken from the subject, the caster regains 1 HP.
Time to cast: 1 minute for every 3
HP drained from the subject.
Prerequisite: Steal Energy.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. The
wearer and item must both touch the
victim. Usable only by a mage. Energy
cost to create: 1,500. (b) Any item. It
lowers wearer’s HP by 1 to 5 while it is
worn. The wearer regains lost HP
when item is removed. Energy cost to
create: 200 per lost HP.

Materialize
Special; Resisted by ST or IQ
This spell is used by ghosts and
other spirits who cannot ordinarily
become visible to beings in the
physical world.
The spell can also be used by a
mage to force a spirit to materialize; in
that case, the ghost resists with the
better of its ST and IQ.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 5 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Summon Spirit.

Solidify
Special; Resisted by ST or IQ
This spell is used by insubstantial
spirits to become tangible and affect
objects and creatures in the substantial world. A tangible spirit is in all
respects like a normal physical being.
The spell can also be used by a
mage to force a spirit to solidify; in
that case, the ghost resists with the
better of its ST and IQ.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 50 to cast. 10 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Materialize.

Affect Spirits
Regular
When cast on a person or object,
this spell allows the subject to interact
with incorporeal spirits as if they were
solid. A weapon with this spell on it
can harm an insubstantial spirit.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Time
to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Solidify.

Item

Turn Spirit
Regular; Resisted by Will
Causes a single subject in spirit form to retreat from the caster. The caster must be able to see the subject. The subject moves away from the cast- er at its current maximum Move until the spell ends or the caster loses sight of it. The subject cannot attack the caster in any way during this time; this includes the use of special powers and spells.
If the spirit possesses a living enti- ty, Turn Spirit will not force the spirit out of its host. Instead, the spirit will flee using the host’s body.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain. Every point of extra casting energy reduces the spirit’s resistance by 1.

Item


Zombie
Regular
The subject of this spell must be a relatively complete dead body. The nature and condition of the corpse determines the nature of the undead creature produced. The animated corpse becomes an undead servant of the caster. Its attributes are based on those of the original body, as are its physical advantages and DX-based skills. It does not have the “soul,” mental traits, IQ-based skills, or memories of the living person. The GM will determine its exact abilities, as appropriate to the campaign.

Undead Templates
The following templates demonstrate three possible types of undead created with the Zombie spell. A normal dead
body produces a zombie; a corpse rotted away to bones produces a skeleton (indeed, zombies rot away to skeletons
over time); and a desiccated cadaver, or a properly embalmed body, becomes a mummy.

Duration: The zombie remains ani- mated until destroyed.
Cost: 8.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Summon Spirit and
Lend Vitality.


Skull-Spirit
Regular
Summons a ghostly assassin to do
the caster’s bidding (see box, p. 150).
Requires the skull of a sapient
creature, which is destroyed in the
casting.
Duration: The spirit lasts for 24
hours unless destroyed first.
Cost: 20.
Prerequisites: Four other Necromantic spells.

Control Zombie
Regular; Resisted by Zombie spell
Take control of an undead creature
raised with the Zombie spell by some
other wizard. If the caster wins a
Quick Contest of Spells with the original Zombie spell, the undead in question will obey the caster as if he had
raised it. The Zombie spell resists at
+2 if the original caster is within 100
yards, and at -2 if he is dead.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Zombie.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by a mage. It does not give the ability
to cast the spell, but gives +2 skill to
one who knows the spell. Energy cost
to create: 500.

Turn Zombie
Area
Inflicts 1d of injury on anything in the area that was animated using the
Zombie spell; DR does not protect. In
addition, roll 1d for each zombie. On a
1, it turns and flees from the caster.
Duration: Successfully turned
undead will avoid the caster for one
day.
Base cost: 2. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Zombie, or “holy
status” (GM’s discretion).

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. At the GM’s
option, this item may work only for a
person with Blessed or Power
Investiture. Energy cost to create: 600.

Zombie Summoning
Special
Calls the nearest zombie to the
caster (for the purposes of this spell, a
zombie is any undead creature created with the Zombie spell). Range is
irrelevant. Upon a successful casting,
the caster knows the location of the
closest zombie (any known zombies
may be excluded if the caster mentions them before casting) and how
long it will take to reach him. The
zombie moves toward the caster as
fast as it can, until it can see him or
the spell ends. If it can reach the caster, it stays nearby, without attacking
or obeying, until the spell ends. The
spell is broken by any attack on the
zombie, and if the zombie fails to
reach the caster before the spell duration ends, it will simply turn and go
about its business, or wander off if it
had none.
Zombies will not answer the summons if it conflicts with their master’s
orders (so you cannot Summon zombies away from whatever they were
guarding, for instance).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain. To
call many zombies, double the cost. All
zombies within a 10-mile radius
(more for a very successful casting)
will be summoned.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Zombie.

Mass Zombie (VH)
Area
Similar to Zombie, but reanimates
all relatively complete dead bodies in
the area of effect. As with Zombie, different sorts of corporeal undead are
made from different qualities of bodies; a mix of undead types may result
from a single Mass Zombie. A corpse
must be lying in its tomb or at its place
of death to be affected by this spell;
otherwise, it won’t be affected.
Corpses in graves up to 4 yards deep
will claw their way up to the surface to
join their new master.

Undead created by this spell
become the loyal servants of the caster. However, they can only be commanded as a group; individual members of the horde cannot be given separate tasks. If this spell is cast ceremonially, the leader of the circle is the
master. The zombies regard the other
members of the circle as his lieutenants; their orders are obeyed, but
the master’s orders take precedence.
Optionally, the mages involved in the
casting may divide the horde equally,
each mage becoming master to his
own segment.
In most likely casting locations,
this spell will raise (R¥R)/2 undead
(round down), where R is the radius of
the spell. It might yield fewer undead
in an upper-class cemetery where the
dead have lots of elbowroom in their
crypts, or more at a mass grave.
Undead created with this spell are
identical to those created with the
Zombie spell. They use the same templates and are affected the same way
by magic.
Duration: Permanent.
Base cost: 7. Minimum radius 2
yards.
Time to cast: A number of minutes
equal to the radius.
Prerequisites:
Zombie
and
Charisma 2 or better.

Slow Healing
Regular; Resisted by HT
Makes the subject less likely to heal
or be healed. The spell subtracts from
any natural recovery roll (p. B424) or
healing skill (First Aid, Physician,
Surgery, etc.), including Healing spells.
Illness, FP recovery and HT-based
resistance rolls are not affected. Only
Remove Curse can break this spell.
Duration: 1 day.
Cost: 1 to 5 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. The same amount is subtracted from any healing roll.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Frailty, and
Steal Vitality.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
175. (b) Any weapon. The wounds it
inflicts are very difficult to heal; the
penalty applies until the wound is
completely healed or the curse is
removed. When attempting healing,
one must specify whether or not the
weapon’s wounds are included; if they
are, the penalty applies. Energy cost to
create: 100 per point of penalty. Double
cost if subject is a missile weapon
(e.g., a bow). Divide cost by 10 if subject is a missile (e.g., an arrow). If the
weapon falls in more than one class,
use the higher cost.

Stop Healing
Regular; Resists Healing
As Slow Healing, except that this
spell resists the natural recovery
process and healing skills and spells.
Every healing attempt on the subject
must be made as a Quick Contest
between the healer’s skill and the Stop
Healing spell’s Endurance (p. 10).
Every failure by the spell to stop a
healing attempt weakens its
Endurance by one; upon reaching
Endurance 0, the spell dissipates. A
critical failure by the Stop Healing or
a critical success by the Resisted spell,
skill, or process also breaks the
enchantment. Otherwise, Remove
Curse is required to undo the spell.
Duration: Until dissipation of the
spell.
Cost: 10.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Slow Healing.

Item
Staff, jewelry, or wand. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 500.

Command Spirit (type)
Regular; Resisted by spirit’s Will
Like Charm (p. 139), but only
affects spirits. Each class of spirits
(banshees, spectres, manitous, etc.)
requires its own spell. No version
exists for demons or elementals; use
Summon Demon or Control
Elemental as appropriate. Unlike the
subject of a Charm spell, the spirit may
try to pervert the caster’s orders, like a
demon (see Summon Demon, p. 155).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 point per 10 character
points used to build the spirit. Half
that (round up) to maintain. (If the
GM does not have a character sheet
for the spirit, 5 energy is a good baseline for minor spirits, or 10 energy for
a more formidable being.)
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Summon Spirit, Turn
Spirit.

Age (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
Makes the subject older! The subject ages one year for every 10 points
of energy put into the spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 10 to 50 points.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Either Youth or six
other Necromantic spells.

Item
(a) Any item. Always on. If worn
(not just touched), it will age the wearer by one year for every day it is worn
(so two hours’ wearing would age you
by a month). Energy cost to create: 500.
(b) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 2,000.

Pestilence
Regular
Infects the subject with a loathsome plague of the caster’s selection
(though the GM may veto an inappropriate selection). The disease takes its
normal course; infection will not
normally be apparent for some time.
Duration: Permanent until cured.
Cost: 6.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1, Steal
Vitality, and Decay.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. The item’s creator sets the plague
transmitted upon creation. Energy
cost to create: 1,000.


Evisceration (VH)
Melee; Resisted by HT or IQ
Reach with one hand into a subject’s body and withdraw a vital organ,
leaving an open cavity.
Extracting the brain instantly kills
the body, but the brain itself may survive for a few minutes! Roll vs. HT each
second; on a success, the brain remains
alive and conscious but loses 1 FP; on a
failure, it dies. While it survives, it can
cast any spells it knows well enough to
cast without ritual. Remember that the
brain has no senses of its own and is
therefore casting blindly.
Extracting the heart demands a
HT-6 roll each turn from the victim;
on a failure he falls unconscious and
dies five seconds later.
Extracting other organs requires a
HT roll at a penalty from 0 to -5 to
remain conscious. Most extractions
kill within a minute; however, some
organ losses can be survived – a lung,
a kidney, etc. In this case, the victim
will still bleed seriously. Restoration is
required to replace a lost organ.
An extracted organ dies within a
minute.
Cost: 10.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Apportation, and Steal Vitality.

Animate Shadow
Regular; Resisted by HT
Summons a spirit that animates the
subject’s shadow and attacks him. The
shadow has IQ 9, HT 10, DX equal to
the caster’s effective skill, and ST and
Move equal to the subject’s ST and
Move. The shadow wields whatever
weapon the subject had in hand at
casting time (even if he drops it later
on!), inflicting basic damage only
(ignore cutting and impaling bonuses)
as fatigue. Armor does not protect, but
the shadow’s attacks may be parried or
blocked if the weapon or shield used to
defend is one that the subject had
when the spell was cast. When the subject’s FP reaches zero, he falls unconscious and the spell is broken. An animated shadow may be attacked as per
a Body of Shadow subject (see p. 114);
if its HP reaches zero, it is “killed” and
the subject regains his normal shadow.
Duration: 5 seconds.
Cost: 4. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Skull-Spirit
Shape Darkness.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 450.

Rotting Death (VH)
Melee; Resisted by HT
The victim, who must be touched
by the caster, rots from within. Every
turn, he must roll against HT; on a failure, he takes 1d-1 damage; 6 points on
a critical failure. A successful roll
means he takes no damage that turn; a
critical success breaks the spell. DR
does not protect!
For the duration of the spell, the
subject feels crippling discomfort,
equivalent to the effects of a Sickness
spell (see p. 138).
The victim appears to be undergoing a devastatingly rapid gangrene.
Hit location should be rolled each
time the spell inflicts damage; once
crippled, a limb is considered to have
rotted off! Once the victim is dead, its
body quickly deliquesces, until only a
puddle of evil-smelling goo is left.
Undead are not affected. The caster
must concentrate while maintaining
this spell, but need not remain in
physical contact.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Sickness,
and Pestilence.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 700.

Soul Jar (VH)
Regular
Traps the subject’s soul in some
object (which must be present). If the
subject is not the caster, then he must
be present, and either willing or
unconscious.
If your soul is in a “jar,” you are
unaffected until either your body dies,
or the jar is destroyed. The death of
your body does not kill you. Your consciousness shifts to the “jar,” where
you are able to see, hear, and even cast
any spell that you know at skill 20 or
above (i.e., castable without speech or
gesturing). You may communicate at

a distance via telepathy-type spells, if
you know any – or by direct mental
contact, without a spell, with anyone
who handles the jar. Your FP remain
the same as when you had a body. You
may not spend HP, but you may use
any Powerstone currently in contact
with your jar.
If a new body comes near the jar,
you may try to take it by a Possession,
Permanent Possession, or Exchange
Bodies spell if you know such a spell.
In that case, the soul of that body goes
into the jar. But if your soul is in a jar,
anything that destroys the jar will kill
you permanently – beyond hope of
resurrection – even if your body is
unharmed.
The spell may be cast again to
switch the soul to a different “jar.”
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 8.
Time to cast: 1 minute. Prerequisite: Magery 1 and six
Necromantic spells, including Steal Vitality.


Summon Demon
Special
This version of Planar Summons (p. 82) raises demons; see that spell description for details. If the caster fails to control the demon, it always attacks him! If it cannot reach the caster (if, for example, the caster is protected by a Pentagram), the demon will vanish (if trapped) or escape to wreak havoc in the outside world.
If he manages to control the demon and give it a command, the demon will carry out the letter of its orders, doing its best to pervert their spirit to the caster’s disfavor. It will also work incidental mischief, unless specifically instructed not to.
At the GM’s discretion, a caster may summon a flock of minor demons whose values add up to 200 character points or less (a caster sum- moning minor demons may never spend more than 20 energy on this spell). In this case, the caster controls the entire flock at once, contesting the highest Will in the flock. A flock of minor demons is not restrained to a single task; they always stay for the entire duration of the spell.

Demon
This type of demon most commonly appears on the mortal plane, a hulking brute with bat-like wings and razor-sharp claws and teeth. Demons are not especially smart, but they are strong, tough, and vicious. Their malicious sense of humor is legendary, and they leave a swath of destruction behind them no matter what task they are set to.
Demons vary widely; these stats are merely a convenient average.

Demon
200 points
Attribute Modifiers: ST+7 [70]; DX+2 [40]; HT+4 [40].
Secondary Characteristic Modifiers: HP+8 [16].
Advantages: Claws (Sharp Claws) [5]; DR 5 [25]; Flight (Winged, -25%; +5
yards per second) [40]; Immune to Metabolic Hazards [30]; Immunity to Mind-Affecting Magic [30]; Magery 0 [5]; Night Vision 5 [5]; Striking ST+2 [10]; Teeth (Sharp Teeth) [1].
Disadvantages: Appearance (Monstrous) [-20]; Bloodlust (12) [-10]; Bully (12) [-10]; Callous [-5]; Cannot Harm Innocents (Prevents direct harm of truly good or holy folks only, -50%) [-5]; Fragile (Unnatural) [-50]; Sadism (12) [-15]; Selfish
(12) [-5]; Social Stigma
(Monster) [-15]. Features: Affected by True
Faith and Pentagram. Skills: Acting (A) IQ-1 [1]-9; Brawling (E) DX+2 [4]- 14; Broadsword (A) DX [2]-12; Fast-Talk (E) IQ+2 [4]-12; Hidden Lore (Demon Lore) (A) IQ-1 [1]-9; Intimidation (E) IQ+2 [4]-12; Stealth (A)
DX [2]-12.

Duration: Until the demon’s task is done, or one hour, whichever is less.
Cost: 1 point per 10 character points used to build the demon. Minimum energy cost is 20 (although this will not always summon a 200-point being). Those tempted to summon powerful demons should bear in mind that such demons tend to have high Will, with all that implies for control . . .
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least one spell from each of 10 different colleges.



Banish
Special; Resisted by Will
Sends an extradimensional visitor
(e.g., a demon) back to its plane of origin. It can only be cast by a caster in
his home dimension. In an alien
plane, you could not “banish” yourself
back home, but a native of that plane
could banish you. This spell will not
work on a creature that is already in
its home dimension.
Resolve the Banish attempt as a Quick Contest: the caster’s Banish skill vs. the subject’s Will. If the caster wins, the subject immediately returns to its home plane. It cannot return for one month. Anything that it brought with it when it appeared (e.g., weapons) will vanish with it. Other things it may be carrying (e.g., screaming victims) stay behind.
Note that certain powerful crea- tures are resistant or even immune to this spell.
Modifiers: +4 if the caster knows the entity’s “true name”; -5 if the cast- er does not know the subject’s plane of origin . . . and an extra -1 if he believes he knows where the creature came from, but is wrong!
Cost: 1 point per 10 character
points the subject is worth. Minimum
energy cost is 10. The caster will not
know in advance how much energy
the spell will require, and may fall
unconscious or even wound himself in
casting the Banish.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
one spell from each of 10 different
colleges.

Item
Some “holy” artifacts are of aid in
banishing actual demons, and items
from the home planes of extradimensional creatures may help in understanding and banishing them. Some
rumored amulets
worn by planar
travelers help them
resist banishment.

Entrap Spirit
Special
Enables the caster to seal a container or chamber so that a spirit within
cannot get out for the duration of the
spell. Getting the spirit into the trap in
the first place is a separate question;
usually Command Spirit is required,
but trickery can be just as effective.
The container can be any size,
from a small bottle up to an entire
building, but it must be fully, tightly
closed (watertight is good enough),
and the mage must touch it while
casting the spell. The spirit cannot
resist the spell, but the casting cost is
directly proportional to its power. The
total cost is equal to the spirit’s ST +
IQ, divided by 5 to cast and by 10 to
maintain. It takes a true effort to
restrain a powerful spirit! The caster
is informed of the energy cost when
the spell takes effect and spends the
energy then; if he cannot meet the
cost, the spirit is unaffected. If the
caster spends half the energy cost, the
spirit takes one second to break out of
the trap; this is a bad deal, but sometimes buying even a second is a
worthwhile thing to do. If multiple
spirits are trapped in a single container, add half the others’ ST and IQ to
the full ST and IQ of the most powerful spirit before calculating cost.
The spirit cannot damage the container or affect anything outside of it,
nor can it use shape-shifting powers to
help it escape in any way. It can communicate with anyone within a yard
or so of the container in the normal
fashion.
Duration: 5 minutes.
Cost: Spirit’s (ST+IQ) divided by 5
to cast, by 10 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Soul Jar,
and Turn Spirit.

Repel Spirits
Area
Repels spirits from an area. The
spell resists attempts by spirits (as well
as other insubstantial beings such as
an Ethereal Body or Astral Trip
subject) to enter it or stay in it.
Each spirit may try to enter the
area once per hour, rolling a Regular
Contest between its Will and the caster’s effective skill (each stage of the
Contest lasts a second). Once inside,
the invader resists with its Will; the
spirit is expelled from the area on its
first failure.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 4 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Banish and Turn
Spirit.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
100. (b) Any area or container can be
made permanently repellent at 100
times casting cost.

Bind Spirit (type) (VH)
Regular; Resisted by spirit’s IQ
Similar to Enslave (p. 141), but for
spirits. Like Enslave, it allows mental
contact with a turn of concentration.
There is a separate Bind Spirit spell
for each Command Spirit spell. The
spirit may interpret its orders
creatively, as per Command Spirit.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 per 3 character points used
to build the spirit (minimum cost 30).
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Command Spirit
(same type), and Soul Jar.

Example: Rolfe, with an IQ of 14,
wishes to steal the wisdom of a victim
with IQ 13 (this is legal; it is assumed
that any character has knowledge and
experiences that would expand the
capabilities of another, even if the
score is lower). If he drains the subject
to IQ 10, he has stolen 3 levels of IQ,
raising his IQ to 17.
Duration: 1 day; at the end of that
time, both the caster and the subject
regain their normal attributes.
Cost: 1 per character point stolen
(minimum cost 10).
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 3. In
addition, there are different spell prerequisites for each version of the spell:
Spell
Steal Might
Steal Dexterity
Steal Wisdom
Steal Vigor

Item
A spirit may be bound to an item or
place. Bound spirits will serve the
owner of the item and will not dissipate.
Energy cost to create: 4 times the cost
above, halved if the spirit is willing.

Steal (Attribute) (VH)
Regular; Resisted by
appropriate attribute
This is actually four separate spells.
Steal Might steals the subject’s ST,
Steal Grace steals DX, Steal Wisdom
steals IQ, and Steal Vigor steals HT.
Each spell must be studied separately,
but all four work identically.
The spell transfers basic attributes
on a level-for-level basis to the caster
from the subject (who must be a living, sapient being). The caster cannot
lower the subject’s attribute below the
subject’s racial average (10 for a
human). Thus, a subject must have an
exceptional score for this spell to
work. Secondary characteristics are
affected by the attribute loss.
The caster must touch the subject
and hold on to him for the entire casting time; neither can do anything while
the spell is being cast. The caster
increases his own attribute (whichever
applies) as if he had spent the character
points stolen from the subject.
Prerequisites
Steal Vitality and
Debility
Steal Vitality and
Clumsiness
Steal Vitality and
Foolishness
Steal Energy and
Frailty

Steal Skill (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Transfers one skill from the subject
to the caster. The caster must touch the
subject and hold on to him for the
entire casting time; neither character
can do anything for that duration. The
outcome of the struggle (i.e., the resistance roll) remains unknown until the
casting is complete. The caster may
abort his casting at any time; the
energy is still spent.
The caster gains the skill as if he
had himself spent the character points
stolen from the subject. This spell can
be used to steal spells.
If the victim had other skills based
on the stolen one, he retains them
fully, but the loss of a prerequisite
causes a -2 penalty to skill use.
Example: Severin wishes to sell
some ill-gotten gains, but lacks much
in the way of business sense. To remedy this, he casts Steal Skill on the first
bazaar merchant he passes, taking his
Merchant skill. The merchant has IQ
10, Business Acumen 2, and
Merchant-15, having spent 12 points
on Merchant. Severin gains Merchant
as if he had spent 12 points on the skill
– with Severin’s IQ of 14, his Merchant
skill is now 17. He does not gain the
benefit of the merchant’s Business
Acumen Talent.
Duration: 24 hours.
Cost: 1 per character point stolen
(minimum cost of 10).
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Borrow
Skill, and Daze.

Steal Youth (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
Take another’s youth. For every 10
points of energy put into this spell, the
caster grows one year younger and the
subject (who must be of the same
race) grows two years older. The subject must either be willing or totally
helpless; the caster must touch the
subject. A critical failure of this spell
costs the caster 1 point of IQ and ages
him by 20 years instantly.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 10 to 30.
Time to cast: 1 hour.
Prerequisite: Youth, Age, and Steal
Vitality.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. The wearer
and the item must both touch the victim. Usable only by mages. This item
can only be used once a year, and only
to steal one year at a time – so one
item keeps one mage young, but no
more. Energy cost to create: 8,000.

Steal Beauty (VH)
Regular
Transfers the subject’s beauty to the
caster. The caster gains one or more
appearance levels (p. B21) while the
subject loses an equal number.
Beauty can only be stolen from
someone of better appearance than the
caster, and the caster cannot gain better
appearance than the subject’s initial
appearance level. The subject must be
of the same species and sex as the caster. In addition, the subject must either
be willing or totally helpless and must
be touched for the entire casting time. A
critical failure of this spell instantly
makes the caster Hideous.
At the GM’s option, this spell may
also be used to steal Charisma and the
Voice advantage. People with stolen
Charisma simply become less scintillating; those with stolen Voices
become mute. Critical failure on
either of these applications results in
muteness for the caster!
Duration: 24 hours; at the end of
this time, both the caster and subject
regain their normal appearance.
Cost: Equal to the character point
difference between the subject’s original and final appearances (or equal to
the cost of the stolen advantage, in the
case of Charisma or Voice).
Time to cast: 30 seconds.

Prerequisites: Magery 3, Alter
Visage, and Steal Vitality.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. The wearer
and the item must both touch the victim. Usable only by mages. Energy cost
to create: 2,500.

Astral Block
Area
No spirit or insubstantial being
may cross an astral block’s boundaries
for the duration of the spell. In addition, insubstantial creatures within an
astral block cannot become substantial, and vice versa. Thus, a sorcerer
could not cast Ethereal Body within
the area of a spell, while a ghost would
be unable to use Solidify. A ghost
already in a tangible state could not
become insubstantial!
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 4 to cast and 2 to maintain if
cast as an Area spell. 15 per cubic yard
if cast on a container, and half that to
maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Summon Spirit and
Repel Spirits.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages. Energy cost to create:
600. (b) Any area or container may be

Lich (VH)
Enchantment
This spell lets the caster become a
lich, a wizard preserved into undeath
with powerful magic and alchemy. He
retains his personality, knowledge, IQ,
skills, and spells, and all his
mental advantages and disadvantages
(including Magery), but gains the
physical and supernatural traits of a
lich, as determined by the GM. The
more powerful that package, the
higher the energy cost.
After the GM determines the lich
template (and hence, the energy cost),
the mage casts this spell as with any
other enchantment, but with himself
as the subject. At the end of the
enchanting, he rolls against skill. Any
failure does 6d damage to the caster. A
success prepares the wizard’s body for
the next step.
To complete the transformation,
the would-be lich must drink an
alchemical elixir of Lichdom. The
elixir of Lichdom is prepared like any
other alchemical elixir (see p. 210); it
requires $13,500 in materials and 50
weeks of brewing. It defaults to
Alchemy-7. Anyone not currently
under the effects of a Lich spell who
imbibes an elixir of Lichdom is affected as if he had drunk an elixir of Death
(p. 215). However, an elixir of Lichdom
cannot be counteracted, even with an
alchemical Antidote. The elixir of
Lichdom is forbidden everywhere, and
formularies for it are almost impossible to find; most liches are compelled
to reinvent it from scratch.
When a wizard under the Lich spell
drinks a potion of Lichdom, he must
roll vs. HT. If he succeeds, he dies, rising as a lich in 2d days. If he fails, he
just dies. Luck, as well as the Bless and
Wish spells, can influence this HT roll.
This is also an Enchantment spell.

Wraith (VH)
Enchantment; Resisted by HT
Enchants a ring or an amulet that
will turn the wearer into a wraith, an

undead guardian sustained by magic.
It attempts to affect the wearer every
time it is put on. The spell is Resisted
normally by HT. If the subject ever
fails to resist (or chooses not to), he
“dies” and rises as a wraith 24 hours
later.
The GM determines the exact abilities of the wraith, but mental traits
are preserved as per the Lich spell.
The wraith always has a Dependency
(p. B130) on the Wraith item (a rare
item, required constantly, for -150
points), and shrivels and dies if it is
removed or destroyed. This item isn’t
Hexed; the victim can remove it and
die if he wishes. Only Remove
Enchantment can reverse the Wraith
spell without harm.
Each Wraith item can sustain one
wraith at a time. Once a given item
has produced a wraith, it has no effect
on other wearers until its wraith has
been destroyed. The Wraith spell has
no effect on the undead.
At double energy cost, the
enchanter can create an item that
makes the wraith his undead servant.
The wraith automatically gains
Reprogrammable (p. B150) with the
enchanter as his master in addition to
his Dependency, and cannot remove
the Wraith item himself.
At half cost, the enchanter can create an item that turns the wearer into
an undead tomb guardian. This works
exactly as a regular Wraith item,
except that the undead gains
Compulsive Behavior (Remain in
tomb and guard it; kill abductors and
return if forcibly removed from tomb)
[-15].

anyone within it begins sneezing,
weeping, and coughing. All victims
suffer a -2 DX penalty for as long as
they are in the cloud and for 3d turns
thereafter.
The rate of dissipation depends on
the area and the presence of wind;

Prerequisite: Shape Plant.

Item

Staff. Usable only by mages. Energy

the one-hour duration of the spell. To
be affected, the entire plant must be

Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 2. Cannot be maintained.

Tangle Growth
Area
Causes grass or other ground
plants within the area to grow and
become obstacles (movement cut to
1⁄2 Move, -2 to dodge), or bushes and
low trees to grow into barriers that
must be removed to pass. Treat such a
barrier as a 3” wooden slab (p. B558)
per yard of width. Anyone in the area
when the spell is cast may move normally on the next turn; only if they fail

False Tracks
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject leaves tracks that
appear to be those of some animal or
other being. Unwilling subjects resist

whether or not the tracker is fooled.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Shape Plant and
Shape Earth.

Item
Footwear. The item must bear a
picture of the animal or being whose
tracks it leaves. Energy cost to create:
300.

Plant Sense
Regular; Resisted by Hide Path
The subject sees and hears minute
details known by the plants around
him – such as disturbances caused by
passing or hiding creatures. This gives
a +4 bonus to Tracking, a +2 bonus to
all Sense rolls, and the ability to detect
the presence of invisible or magically
hidden creatures with a normal Sense
roll. Works only in areas with thick
plant growth (jungles, forests, etc.);
may work at half effect (with no
chance to sense invisible or magically
hidden creatures) in sparser terrain.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Forest Warning and
Hide Path.


Item
Staff or figurine. Energy cost to create: 500.

Rejuvenate Plant
Regular
Causes a dead, dying, or old plant
to undergo a sudden burst of life.
Tables (or longbows!) sprout leaves,
an aging fruit tree bears fruit once
more, etc. Whether the plant can sustain this new vitality depends on its
immediate surroundings. A rejuvenated chair would die slowly unless its
legs could grow roots into nourishing
soil, for example.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Plant
Growth.

Staff. Usable only by mages; the
item must touch the subject. Energy
cost to create: 700.

Wither Plant
Area; Resisted by HT
Causes plants within the area to wither and die. The caster can choose to affect only one type of plant, or everything but one type of plant, if he wishes. Any large plants or animated vegetable foes should be assigned a HT score with which to resist this spell – see Animate Plant.
Duration: Permanent. Base cost: 2.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Blight.

Item
Staff or wand of dead wood. Energy
cost to create: 200.

Walk Through Plants
Regular
Enables the subject to pass through
grass, undergrowth, heavy forest or
jungle without any hindrance from the
vegetation. He can travel as if the land
were open (normal movement rates);
plants move aside to let him pass and
then resume their previous position
behind him.
The spell makes tracking difficult,
giving a penalty from -1 to -8, depending on the thickness of the local vegetation. If used against Tangle Growth,
a Quick Contest of spells must take
place every second.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Hide Path and Shape
Plant.

Item
Cloak of plant material. Energy cost
to create: 400.

Walk Through Wood
Regular
Enables the subject to pass
through solid wood (dead or alive) as
if it were air. It does not open a passage so that others can follow, nor
does it reveal what is on the other side
. . . The subject should hold his breath,
as the spell does not supply any air!
Should the spell end before the
subject regains the open air, he is
buried in wood. He is not automatically harmed, but suffocates (p. B436)
if he cannot escape.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Walk Through Plants.

Item
Cloak of plant material. Energy cost
to create: 500.

Plant Control
Regular; Resisted by Will
Control the actions of one large
vegetable (any size) or a group of
small ones, up to about 100 pounds
total – useful only if the plant can
move spontaneously to start with.
Concentration is required. This spell
will not work on a sapient vegetable
(IQ 6 or higher). Note that this spell
makes possible the use of Rider, Rider
Within, Beast Possession, and similar
spells on vegetable creatures. Plant
Control is Resisted by Animate Plant.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. Half that to maintain.
Prerequisite: Plant Sense.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 600 (will control any type of
vegetable).

Essential Wood
Regular
Transforms any intact wood into
the magical essence of wood. Essential Wood is three times as strong as
regular wood, with three times the HP
and DR listed on p. B558, and three
times the ability to support weight. It
is difficult to ignite with regular
flames (Highly Resistant, according to
the chart on p. B433), but once lit
burns three times as long. It also
burns hotter, adding an extra point of
damage to each die (this will even
increase the heat of Essential Flame!).
Manufactured objects made of
wood can be turned into objects made
of Essential Wood; living plants, however, may not be transformed.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 8.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Six Plant spells.

Item
Staff. Usable only by mages. Cost to
create: 800 energy.

Animate Plant
Regular
As Animation (p. 150), except only
one living plant may be animated. An
animated plant gains a HT score equal
to twice the energy put into the spell.
Note that woody plants often have a
high DR and make frightening foes.
A sapient (IQ 6 or higher) plant
may not be animated.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. Half that to maintain. Double cost if the plant is to pull
itself up and walk (Move 4) on its
roots!
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Seven Plant spells.

Plant Form
Special
Assume the form of any natural
plant or tree between 1⁄2 and five
times your own size. Clothing vanishes, to reappear when you regain your
form; large possessions fall to the ground, while small ones (up to
bracelet or wand size) may remain
imbedded in your plant form.
The caster cannot move about,
attack, etc., unless a plant with those
abilities exists in the game world and
he takes that form, or unless Animate
Plant is cast on his plant form. A wizard in plant shape may cast no spells
unless he knows them so well that he
can cast them without speech or gesture! He may hear normally but may
not see except to sense light and
darkness. He may not speak.
Injuries taken in plant form carry
over proportionately. This means, for
instance, that an arrow wound to a tree
is a pinprick to a man; some GM flexibility is required here! Time spent in
plant form automatically counts as
“rest” unless the plant is under attack.
However, he must roll against IQ every
hour that he stays in plant form. A
failed roll temporarily reduces his IQ by
1. If IQ drops to 5, he is trapped in plant
form, with a plant’s IQ, until someone
else frees him with Remove Curse.

Plant Meta-Traits
Body of Wood: Your body is made of wood. Basic Speed-1 [-20]; Lifting
ST +5 [15]; Blunt Claws [3]; DR 2 (Semi-Ablative, -20%) [8]; Doesn’t
Breathe [20]; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards [30]; Injury Tolerance
(Homogenous) [40]; Numb [-20]; and Affected by Plant spells [0]. 76
points.

slime mold. Amphibious [10]; Doesn’t Breathe [20]; Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards [30]; Injury Tolerance (Homogenous) [40]; Bad Smell
[-10]; Disturbing Voice [-10]; Invertebrate [-20]; Affected by Plant spells
[0]. 60 points.

Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and six
Plant spells.

Plant Speech
Regular
“Converse” with plants in a very
rudimentary fashion (semi-telepathically; the mage must speak aloud).
The older the plant, the more detailed
the information that can be gained.
For instance, grass could only tell that
it had been stepped on recently (about
a day), while an ancient oak could
recall details of mounts, dress, aroma
. . . Sapient vegetables can hold much
better conversations.
Duration: 1 minute. Each minute
allows one question and answer.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Plant
Sense.

Item
Staff. Energy cost to create: 750 for
an item that will talk to one particular
species, 2,000 for one that will talk to
any plant.


Rain of Nuts
Area
Causes a rain of nuts to fall within
the area, issuing from the nearby trees
as if they were suddenly filled with
crazed squirrels. The noisy torrent
plinks on helmets, stings bare skin,
and interferes with missile fire. Any
characters in the area take a -1 penalty to any tasks requiring concentration or skill, including combat and
spellcasting. There’s an additional visibility penalty of -1 per 8 yards distance, applied to missile attacks and
Vision rolls. The caster may elect to
exclude any in the area from the
effects of the spell, focusing the “ire”
of the wood on enemies.
This spell may only be cast outdoors, in a forest. It won’t work in the
dead of winter, or in very sparse woods.
Depending on the species of trees, the
nuts may turn out to be edible.
Human mages rarely use this spell
(most feel it is beneath their dignity),
but sylvan species and nature spirits
use it to drive intruders from their
woods.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1/10 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. For double cost, the caster
may double the effect of the spell (-2
skill penalties and visibility -1 per 4
yards), if the GM agrees that the
woods are sufficiently dense and wild.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
six Plant spells including Shape Plant.



Arboreal Immurement
Regular; Resisted by HT
Similar to Entombment, except
that a tree, instead of the earth, confines the subject. The subject is
instantly swallowed by the nearest
tree large enough to contain him. He
remains in suspended animation (as
with the spell; see p. 94) in a tiny cylindrical chamber inside the tree, until
rescued by chopping through the tree
or the cancellation of the spell.
A mage who casts Arboreal
Immurement on himself may elect to
stay awake, but this is unwise unless
he can create air!
Modifiers: Apply the long-distance
modifier (p. 14) for the distance from
the subject to the nearest tree large
enough to hold him.
Duration: Indefinite.
Cost: 8 to cast. 5 to reverse an
Arboreal Immurement.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Walk
Through Wood.

Item
Wand or staff. The item must be
wooden, and works only with trees of
that wood. Usable only by mages; the
item must touch the subject. Energy
cost to create: 1,000.

Plant Form Other (VH)
Special; Resisted by Will
As Plant Form, but usable on others. Only the caster or a Remove Curse
spell can end the spell. IQ loss will
soon transform the subject into a true
vegetable!

Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Plant
Form.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 3,000.

Body of Wood
Regular; Resisted by HT
Subject becomes an animated
wooden statue, temporarily granting
him the Body of Wood meta-trait (see
box). Clothes (up to 6 pounds) also
become wood, but lose any magic
powers they might have had. He may
still speak, cast spells, etc.
A subject under the effects of Body
of Wood may also merge into wooden
objects as if he had the Permeation
(Wood) advantage (p. B75).
Duration: 1 minute. The spell
expires if the subject loses
consciousness.
Cost: 7 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Plant
Form.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,300.

Body of Slime
Regular; Resisted by HT
The aquatic equivalent of Body of
Wood. The subject becomes an animated mass of green slime – algae,
pond scum, and other muck you
might find in a swamp – temporarily
granting him the Body of Slime metatrait (see box). Clothes (up to 6
pounds) are also transformed, but lose
any magic powers they might have
had.
Duration: 1 minute. The spell
expires if the subject loses
consciousness.
Cost: 6 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Plant
Form, and Shape Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,300.

Duration: 1 hour.


Sense Danger
Information
Tells the caster if any immediate
danger is nearby; can also detect a faraway danger if it threatens to come
close and strike! Gives the nature of
any danger that is only a minute or so
away; if there is a danger within five
minutes, the spell produces foreboding but no details (except possibly on
a critical success).
Duration: Instantaneous.
Cost: 3.
Prerequisite: Sense Foes or the
advantage of Danger Sense.

Detect Poison
Area; Information
Reveals the presence of toxins and
gives a +2 on any subsequent Poisons
roll to identify the exact agent(s). The
caster may exclude any types of poisons he wishes upon casting (to
specifically search for nerve agents,
for instance, or to exclude “benign”
poisons like alcohol).
This is also a Healing spell.
Base cost: 2.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Sense Danger or Test
Food.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 250.

Magelock
Regular; Resists Lockmaster spell
Locks a door magically. The door
does not open unless the spell is
removed (Counterspell and
Lockmaster will both counter it) or
the door itself is destroyed.
Duration: 6 hours.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 400.

Block
Blocking
An instantaneous version of the
Shield spell – adds to the subject’s DB
for a single defense roll. This spell is
not cumulative with the effects of
Shield – use the highest value.
Cost: 1 per point of DB (maximum
of 5).
Prerequisite: Magery 1.

Hardiness
Blocking
An instantaneous version of the
Armor spell – adds to the Damage
Resistance of the subject for one
attack. This spell is not cumulative
with Armor – only the stronger spell
applies. Remember that only one
Blocking spell may be cast in a turn. A
mage cannot follow up a failed Iron
Arm with a Hardiness spell, for
instance.
Cost: 1 per point of DR (maximum
of 5).
Prerequisite: Block.

Watchdog
Area
When cast around an area, this
spell warns the caster of anyone or
anything crossing with hostile intent.
If the caster is asleep, he wakes
instantly without being stunned. The
spell is not destroyed if triggered; it
lasts until its natural expiration.
Duration: 10 hours.
Base cost: 1 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Sense Danger.

Item
Can be cast on an area of floor or
ground, or on a rug. Energy cost to
create: 200 per yard of radius.

Nightingale
Area
Makes a door or section of floor
“noisy.” A door squeaks loudly when
opened; a patch of ground becomes
full of snapping sticks when someone
walks over it; a floor squeaks, etc. This
automatically alerts or awakes the
caster if he is within hearing range,
and probably alerts others nearby as
well (make an IQ roll if there is other
noise around).
Duration: 10 hours.

Base cost: 2 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Sense Danger.

Item
Can be cast on an area of floor or
ground, or on a rug. Energy cost to
create: 100 per yard of radius.

Sense Observation
Area
Alerts the caster if someone or
something spies or scries upon the subject area, by means magical or otherwise. A Quick Contest is rolled between
the spy’s IQ or the effective skill of the
Information spell’s caster (Trace,
Seeker, Crystal Ball, any of the “Sense”
spells . . .) and the effective skill of the
Sense Observation spell’s caster; if the
caster wins, he becomes aware that the
subject area is being observed. A critical
success (on the Contest) might give the
caster an idea of who or what is doing
the scrying or spying.
If the caster then tries to seek out
the spy, the margin of success of the
Sense Observation contest can be
added as a bonus to the Seeker roll, up
to a maximum of +5 (effectively neutralizing the -5 penalty for having nothing associated with the person sought).
Another possible course of action is to
Counterspell the scrying spell; distance
penalties do not apply, but the -5 penalty for absent subject does.
Sense Observation can also be cast
on a being; in that case, the caster can
choose to have the spell alert the subject
instead when eavesdropping is detected.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1 to cast. Half that to
maintain. When cast on a being, the
cost is 3.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Sense Danger or
Scryguard.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 300. (b) Jewelry or
clothing. Always on. Only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,500.

Shield
Regular
Conjures an invisible shield of magical force that moves to protect the subject from frontal attacks. The Defense
Bonus granted by this spell is cumulative with that from an actual shield, but

this spell does not allow a subject without a shield to block. Defense Bonus
granted by Shield is not cumulative
with any granted by Block (p. 166).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Twice the Defense Bonus given
to the subject, to a maximum DB of 4
(cost 8). Half that to maintain.
Prerequisite: Magery 2.

Item
None with this spell – but the
armor enchantment called Deflect
(p. 67) can increase your Defense
Bonus by 1 to 5 points.

Armor
Regular
Adds to the Damage Resistance of
a living subject. DR from this spell is
treated for all purposes like DR from
armor, and is cumulative with that
from actual armor.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Twice the Damage Resistance
given to the subject, to a maximum
DR of 5 (cost 10). Half that to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shield.

Item
None with this spell – but the armor
enchantment called Fortify (p. 66) can
increase the Damage Resistance of
your armor by 1 to 5 points.

Turn Blade
Blocking
Makes an incoming blade turn in
its wielder’s hand, inflicting only
crushing damage instead of cutting.
This also unreadies the weapon. Only
good against blade attacks – it is useless against a spear, club, or the teeth
and claws of an animal. This spell
does not count as an active defense
itself; it may be combined with a normal Parry, Block, or Dodge.
If the caster is not the one being
attacked, apply regular range modifiers
between the caster and the attacker.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Apportation or Spasm.

Item
A bracelet or other piece of arm
apparel. Energy cost to create: 300.

Bladeturning
Regular
A continual version of Turn Blade –
all blades attacking the subject are
turned, doing only crushing damage
and becoming unready. For each bladed attack, roll a Quick Contest
between the wielder’s DX and the caster’s effective skill to see which wins
out. Useful only against blade attacks,
as per Turn Blade.
Note that, unlike Turn Blade, the
spell is cast on the one being attacked,
not on the attacker.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shield or Turn Blade.

Item
Wand, staff, jewelry, weapon, or
armor. Energy cost to create: 300.

Missile Shield
Regular
Turns any missiles harmlessly
aside by the tiniest fraction needed to
ensure they miss the subject; the game
effect is that the missile continues in a
straight line past the subject. Works
on all kinds of missiles – arrows, bullets, falling rocks, missile spells, shrapnel, cream pies – everything. The GM
should conceal the existence of the
spell from the caster’s foes as long as
possible, saying they just missed!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Apportation or Shield.

Item
Wand, staff, weapon, or armor.
Energy cost to create: 400.


Item
Wand, staff, weapon, or armor.
Energy cost to create: 600.

Return Missile
Blocking
Causes one missile (including
spells) about to hit the subject to turn
back upon the attacker. If the attacker’s
“to hit” was successful, he hits himself
– if not, he sees the missile fly back
toward him and miss. Considered a
Parry (by the caster) for combat purposes. Apply Regular range modifiers
if the caster is not the subject.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Catch Missile.

Item

Catch Missile
Blocking
The caster catches one missile
about to hit him. This spell is cast with
a modifier depending on the nature of
the missile caught. Considered a Parry
by the caster for combat purposes.
The missile is unready when caught.
To catch a missile spell, use Catch
Spell.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Deflect Missile.

Reflect Gaze (VH)
Blocking;
Resists gaze attacks
Resists one gaze attack (includes
Lightning Stare, Fascinate, and any
power which requires eye contact)
about to hit the subject. If successful,
the gaze attack is reflected away from
the subject; a success by 10 or more, or
a critical success, reflects the gaze back
upon the attacker. If failed, the gaze
attack affects the subject normally.
Considered a parry by the caster for
combat purposes. Apply Regular range
modifiers if the caster is not the subject.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Mirror.

Item
Jewelry. Energy cost to create: 600;
must include a tiny mirror.

Reverse Missiles
Regular
Turns any ranged attack (including
Missile spells) back upon the attacker.
If the attacker’s “to hit” roll is successful, he hits himself – if not, he sees the
missile fly back toward him and miss.
The game effect is as though the missile had bounced straight back from
the spell’s subject to the attacker.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 7 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Missile Shield or
Force Dome.


Mystic Mist
Area
Produces a dense, opalescent fog
that confuses anyone entering it; figures
more than 2 yards away cannot be seen
except by Mage Sight. Those who were
within it when it was cast are immune to
its effects; they can sense it as a dim
shimmering, but it does not affect their
vision or confuse them. Others must roll
vs. (IQ + Magic Resistance) every second, or use Mage Sight, to avoid losing
their way and walking in randomly chosen directions, unless they have a guide.
Absolute Direction avoids this problem.
A Fright Check is also required of
intruders first entering the mist, and
again every 5 minutes. Anyone failing
the first Fright Check will be very
reluctant to enter! Dangerous animals
simply avoid the mist, but suffer normal effects if for some reason they
must enter it.
Those “native” to the mist have a
+1 to their defense rolls when attacked
by interlopers, and interlopers have a
-1 to their own defense rolls against
“natives.”
This spell is an excellent defense for
a party camping in dangerous territory.
The caster must cast Mystic Mist in an
area centered on himself. The wider an
area he can cover, the better!
Duration: 10 hours.
Base cost: 1. Cost to maintain is the
same.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and either
Watchdog or Shield.

Item
(a) Amulet that keeps wearer
immune to the effects of Mystic Mist.
Energy cost to create: 400. (b) It is
rumored that there is an object that
creates a permanent Mystic Mist, controllable in some way, but nothing
more is known at present.

Shade
Regular
Provides shade for the subject. This
prevents sunburn and provides some
relief from heat (reducing the effective
temperature around the subject by
10˚F, if hot light is a significant source
of the heat). The effect is that of an
invisible parasol.
This is also a Light and Darkness
spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 1 to cast. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Continual Light or
Shield.

Item
Staff or jewelry. Only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 100.

Iron Arm
Blocking
Stop a blow with only
an arm. If the spell
succeeds, the arm
becomes harder
than
iron,
momentarily –
and automatically parries the
attacking
weapon without
harm to the caster.
If the spell fails, the
wizard is simply parrying with his arm! This
spell can parry no attack that a
sword could not parry, and is considered a parry for purposes of combat.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisites: Resist Pain and DX
11 or higher.

Atmosphere Dome
Area
Creates a shimmering dome that is
selectively permeable to gases. It can
either drive out specified gases, or
draw them in. When the dome is created, the caster defines a target atmospheric composition; when the target
level for each component gas is
reached, the dome ceases acting on
that gas until conditions inside the
dome change. The composition selected by the caster specifies both proportions and total pressure; this spell can
thus be used either to change the
composition of the air within
the dome or its pressure relative to the surrounding
area, or both. An
Atmosphere Dome cannot create gas where
none exists; if there is
no oxygen in a planet’s
atmosphere, a dome
set to accumulate oxygen remains empty.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 6 hours.
Base cost: 4 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Purify Air and
Weather Dome.

Resist Pressure
Regular
Protects the subject from the effects of pressures higher or lower than his native pressure, providing the equivalent of Pressure Support (p. B77) or Vacuum Support (p. B96). The caster must select that advantage the spell grants and at what level at the time of casting.
This spell is most appropriate in scientific-paradigm settings; if the space between the planets is filled with ordinary air and the bottom of the ocean is much like the bottom of a river, there’s not much use for this spell.
Resist Pressure does not enable the subject to breathe in the environments it renders survivable; Breathe Water or Hold Breath may be useful in these situations.

Advantage           Energy Cost
Pressure Support 1  2 to cast; 1 to maintain
Pressure Support 2  3 to cast; 2 to maintain
Pressure Support 3  5 to cast; 3 to maintain
Vacuum Support      3 to cast; 2 to maintain

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Varies with the advantage conferred.
Prerequisite: Weather Dome.

Item
A bracelet or other item worn on
the arm. Energy cost to create: 600.

Weather Dome
Area
Creates a shimmering dome that
repels bad weather of all types (up to
and including Windstorm spells, volcanic ash, and rains of frogs, as well as
flying insects!). Floods, landslides, and
similar catastrophes destroy the
dome. Inside the dome, the air
remains fresh and the temperature
remains comfortable for the caster.
This is also a Weather spell.
Duration: 6 hours.
Base cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.

Item

Force Wall
Regular
Creates a shimmering barrier,
which physical forces and missile
spells cannot cross. Only light and
non-Missile spells may pass. The
Force Wall is four yards high. Higher
walls are possible at a proportionately increased energy cost (double for
double height, etc).
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 2 per yard length to cast.
Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Force Dome.


Force Dome
Area
As Weather Dome, but the Force
Dome repels any physical force or
missile spell. Nothing can enter except
light, and only enough light to see by
(the interior is always in twilight).
Likewise, nothing can leave the Force
Dome except light – and not even that,
if the caster wills it. However, magic,
and magical creatures and items, pass
through the Force Dome as though it
did not exist.
Once cast, a Force Dome takes a
full second to form; anyone inside the
Dome’s area at the time it is cast has
one turn to leave.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Base cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Weather
Dome, and Apportation.

Item

(a) Staff. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 300. (b) A Force
Wall may be made permanent at an
energy cost of 100 times normal.


Teleport Shield
Area
Any attempt to Teleport (or Blink)
into or out of the area of effect is at -5
to skill. Failed attempts to teleport in
have the normal effects. Failed
attempts to teleport out leave the
caster where he started, physically
stunned and having spent all the energy for the attempt! Doubling the
energy cost increases the penalty to
-10; tripling it increases the penalty to
-15!
This spell works against Teleport,
Timeport, Plane Shift, Timeslip, and
all their variations.
This is also a Gate spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1⁄3 to cast (minimum 3yard radius). Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Watchdog and either
Spell Shield or Teleport.

Item
Can be cost on an area of floor or
ground, or on a rug or similar item.
Energy cost to create: 50 per yard
radius.

Utter Dome
Area
Protects against physical and magical attack; has the effect of a combination Force Dome and Pentagram.
However, creatures cannot be summoned within it, and there is no marking to erase. Can only be removed by
Dispel Magic or Counterspell. Resists
any attempt to look through with magic.
Like Force Dome, an Utter Dome
takes a full second to form once cast.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 6 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Force
Dome, and Spell Shield.

Utter Wall
Regular;
Resists intruding spells
As Force Wall, but protects against
physical and magical attack; has the
effect of a combination Force Wall
and Spell Wall.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 per yard length to cast.
Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisites: Utter Dome and Spell
Wall.

Item
(a) Staff. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b) An
Utter Wall may be made permanent at
an energy cost of 100 times normal.


Sound Vision
Regular
The subject sees by sound, like a bat
or dolphin, as if he had the Scanning
Sense (Sonar) advantage (p. B81). The
Silence and Wall of Silence spells are
equivalent to Darkness to the subject,
while someone using Hush or MageStealth will be effectively invisible to
Sound Vision. The subject may still see
with his normal vision, if he wants to
and there is light to do so.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Keen Hearing or the
Acute Hearing advantage.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry; only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 400.


Sound
Regular
Produces any sort of meaningless
sound the caster wishes – the drone of
an insect, the distant babble of voices,
the clatter of something falling, or
anything similar. The spell cannot
produce loud noise. It requires no
concentration once the spell is cast.
Cost: 1 to create 5 seconds of sound; 2 to create a sound that
lasts for a full minute; 1 per minute to maintain.

Item
Any. Continually produces the
specified sound (though Link is often
used to turn it on and off). Energy cost
to create: 50.

Thunderclap
Regular
Produces a single loud sound like
an explosion or crash of thunder. The
“subject” is the spot the caster chooses
as the spell’s center. Outdoors, anyone
within 3 yards of this place must make
a HT roll or be deafened; anyone deafened may roll vs. HT every hour to
recover. In an enclosed area – less than
10 yards in any dimension – increase
this distance to 6 yards! The caster
makes his roll at HT+2.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisite: Sound.

Item
Gloves, staff, wand, or jewelry.
Energy cost to create: 300.


Silence
Area
Creates an area of quiet. No one
within this area can hear anything,
and nothing that happens in this area
makes any sound. It is the area that is affected and not the people in it; any- one moving out will be able to speak. Note that an area of silence will prevent spoken spells from working!
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain. Prerequisite: Sound.


Voices
Regular
Produces a meaningful sound –
voices, music, etc. – of normal speaking volume. Requires constant
concentration on the part of the caster.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Sound.

Item
Any. The item repeats a single saying over and over (unless limited with
Link). Energy cost to create: 20 per
word.

Garble
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject (a living being) can no
longer make meaningful sounds; it
comes out completely garbled. This
spell could make an opposing wizard
powerless!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Voices.

(a) Clothing or jewelry; only affects
the wearer. Always on. Energy cost to
create: 400. (b) Staff or wand. Usable
only by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 1,000.

Imitate Voice
Regular; Resisted by HT
Alters the subject’s voice to precisely imitate that of a single other being
known to the caster (including special
inflections and accent). Recreating a
familiar voice from memory is a -2
penalty to skill, -3 or worse if the
caster has only heard the voice a few
times or a long time ago (Eidetic or
Photographic Memory is helpful here).
To determine whether someone familiar with the imitated being’s voice is
fooled or not, roll a Quick Contest
between the spell and the listener’s IQ
when he first hears it.
Modifiers: +2 for close acquaintances of the imitated being; -2 for listeners
who are not expecting trickery or
aren’t paying close attention.

Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Voices.

Wall of Silence
Area
Surrounds the affected area with a
wall that sounds will not pass. Those
within it cannot hear outside sounds,
or be heard by those outside. Casting
of spoken spells is unaffected.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Silence.

Item
As for Silence, but the cost is 100
per yard radius.

Hush
Regular; Resisted by Will
The subject (an object or living
being) can make no sounds, either
accidentally or on purpose. Add 3 to
the subject’s Stealth skill whenever a
roll is necessary, or subtract 5 from the
Hearing roll of anyone listening for
the subject. This spell can silence an
opposing wizard in battle!
Duration: 10 seconds if subject
attempted to resist, 1 minute otherwise.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Silence.

Item
Clothing or jewelry; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 200.

Mage-Stealth
Regular
The subject can move quietly,
breathe without sound, etc., but can
still talk when necessary. Other
benefits are as for Hush.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Hush.

Item
Clothing or jewelry; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 500.

Great Voice
Regular
The subject can be heard clearly and
distinctly by everyone he can see, even
at a great distance. The subject can
choose to be heard by only a few chosen
targets if he specifies before speaking
(those within ordinary earshot will hear
him whether he wants it or not, of
course). Note that, for instance, one
could not cut off the subject’s voice by
ducking behind a rock. This spell is
widely used by ship captains, military
commanders, and public speakers. The
sound may become irritatingly loud if
the original voice is loud, but will not
deafen or cause harm.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites:
Voices
and
Thunderclap.

Resist Sound
Regular
The subject (person, creature or
object), and anything he carries,
becomes immune to the effects of
sound: Thunderclaps won’t deafen
him, sonic weapons won’t harm him,
Sound Jet won’t stun him, and so on.
Noise may still distract, however. Very
popular at high TLs.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: At least four Sound
spells.


Noise
Area
Fills an area with meaningless,
continuous, very loud noise. No one
within this area can have a conversation or hear other sounds. Use of any
IQ-based skill is either distracted
(spells, for example), or at -3 (or both!
GM’s choice). A Wall of Silence surrounds the affected area. Resists (and
is Resisted by) Silence.
Duration: 5 seconds.
Base cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Wall of Silence.


Delayed Message
Area
Creates an oral message, which can
be delayed to go off until a certain person, specified at casting, arrives in the
area. The recipient hears it clearly, regardless of other noise, but nobody
else hears it. A Detect Magic spell cast
in the area reveals that it contains a
delayed message, but only a critical
success reveals more. A critical success
reveals one of the following (roll randomly): the sender, the intended recipient, or the words (not any hidden
meanings) of the message.
This does not count as a “continuing spell” – the mage casts it and
forgets about it.
Duration: Until the specified person arrives.
Cost: 3 per simple sentence – one
idea per sentence. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Voices, and
Sense Life.



Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by a mage. Energy cost to create: 400.


Converse
Regular
Allows the caster and his subject to
converse quietly without fear of eavesdropping, even in a noisy environment
(such as a raucous party). Each one
will hear the words of the other clearly regardless of the surrounding din.
Other beings within earshot will hear
a meaningless buzz of conversation.
Converse resists spells that block
sound such as Silence or Noise.
Duration: As long as eye contact is
maintained.
Cost: 2.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Garble,
and Silence.

Item
Any. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 150.

Sound Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin beam of very shrill
sound from a fingertip. Each turn, the
caster rolls versus Innate Attack or
DX-4 to hit. This attack may be
dodged or blocked, but not parried.
The spell does no actual damage, but
anyone hit by the jet must roll versus
their HT minus the energy cost of the
spell or be stunned (see Effects of Stun,
p. B420). DR gives a +1 bonus to the
target’s effective HT for every five
points of DR. Every turn, a stunned
person may roll vs. HT minus the energy cost of the spell to recover.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. Range in yards is equal to
energy cost.
Prerequisite: Great Voice.


Far-Hearing
Information
The caster can hear any conversation that he can see, even at a great
distance, or hear through solid objects
totaling no more than six feet of thickness. He automatically makes all
Hearing rolls.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Magery 1 and four
other Sound spells. May not have
Deafness or Hard of Hearing;.

Item
Clothing or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 400.


Scribe
Regular
Animates a pen, which writes down
whatever the caster dictates for the
duration of the spell. If the caster fails
by only 1 or 2 points, the pen is still animated, but the transcription is not perfectly accurate! Therefore, the caster
should always double-check his work.
At higher TLs, this spell may also be
used with typewriters, computer keyboards, and other transcription devices.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Voices, Dancing
Object, and must have Accented or
better written comprehension in at
least one language.

Item
A pen may be permanently animated at an energy cost of 250. For an additional 100 points of energy (which may
be a separate enchantment) the caster
may attune it to someone else’s words.


Message
Regular; Resisted by spells that block sound
Send a spoken message to a subject. Use the long-distance modifiers
(p. 14). If the caster doesn’t know the
subject, he is at -2. If he doesn’t know
the subject’s whereabouts, he is also at
-5 (a successful Seeker spell will eliminate this). These penalties may be
cumulative. A successful Trace gives a
+5 bonus.
The subject hears the message
clearly and distinctly whatever his
sonic surroundings, but nobody else
hears it. Silence, Wall of Silence, and
Noise will resist the incoming message.
This is also a Communication and
Empathy spell.
Duration: The message travels to
the subject at 50 mph. This speed doubles when the casting cost is doubled.
Cost: 1 per 15 seconds of message
duration.
Time to cast: Equal to the message’s
duration, as spoken by the caster.
Prerequisites: Great Voice and
Seeker.

Item

Musical Scribe
Regular
Animates a pen, which records in
musical notation any tune that the
caster hums, sings, or plays on an
instrument. The caster may also
attune the pen to the sounds created
by another person (or by a radio, etc.),
instead of himself. The pen records
only the music; if lyrics are to be
recorded simultaneously, a second
pen with Scribe cast on it can follow
along and do so!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Increase cost by 1 (both casting and
maintenance) if the paper supplied is
not properly ruled for musical
notation (the pen has to work harder
supplying the lines as well as the
notes!)
Prerequisite: Scribe.

Item
(a) Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 200. (b)
Jewelry; must bear a picture of a
nightingale. Always on, only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 600.

Wizard Ear
Regular
Creates a replica of the caster’s
physical ear, through which he can
hear. The ear may move about without
bumping into things (as if it had
Sound Vision), though it cannot “see”
more than the general size and shape
of halls and rooms. This spell may be
cast on an already existing Wizard Eye
(regular or invisible); this does not
change its shape, but allows it to hear
conversation and other sounds.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Apportation, FarHearing, and Sound Vision.

Item
Any painting or sculpture depicting
a human ear may be turned into an
immobile Wizard Ear, through which
the holder of an ear-shaped amulet,
enchanted at the same time, may hear
regardless of distance. Each such Ear
links only to one amulet, and vice
versa. Energy cost to cast: 450.

Invisible Wizard Ear
Regular
Creates a Wizard Ear that cannot
be seen without the See Invisible spell.
Anyone who guesses where it is may
still attack, but the cumulative modifiers from invisibility and its small size
make it nigh impossible to hit.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisites: Wizard Ear and
Invisibility.

Silver Tongue
Regular
Grants the subject the Voice advantage (p. B97). The spell has no effect on
beings that already have the advantage.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.

Seek Machine/TL
Information
Identifies the direction and approximate distance of the nearest machinery of any sort. The caster can also
specify that he is looking for a specific
sort of device; lasers, computers, light
sources, etc. Any known examples of
technology may be excluded if the
mage specifies them before casting.
Use long-distance modifiers (p. 14).
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 100.


Reveal Function/TL
Information; Resisted by spells to conceal magic
Reveals the functions of the subject
machine. If the subject has more than
one function, the spell reveals them in
order of complexity (simplest first), and
tells the caster “there are more functions.” Later castings will reveal the
remaining functions, one per casting.
The spell can also be used to reveal
how to activate known functions (i.e.,
which button to press); the caster gets
one try, at -5! If successful, the caster
can then use the machine with the
appropriate skill (or IQ-6) at a penalty
of only -1 for unfamiliarity.
Cost: 8.
Time to cast: 10 minutes.
Prerequisite: Seek Machine.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 1,500.

Machine Control/TL
Regular
Control the actions of one machine
(anything under IQ 6, of any size) or a
swarm of small ones, up to about 1,000
machines or 100 pounds total. The caster must be aware of the machine’s functions to control it. The spell does not
supply the skill to use the machine – the
caster must use his own skill at Gunner,
Computer Operation, Driving, and so
on. Concentration is required.
The spell acts through the
machine’s triggers and controls,
mechanical or electrical. A mage
could use the spell to make a camera
snap a picture, a robot strangle its evil
creator, or a gun discharge all of its
ammunition. He could not aim the
object, or move it, unless it was selfaiming or self-propelled (at least without adding an Apportation spell).
If something else has control (an AI
in a vehicle or a human operator at the
driver’s seat, for instance), then he/it
may dispute control of the machine
every second with a Quick Contest of
the caster’s effective skill vs. the operator’s skill (or Will+TL for cybernetic
control).
A mage who knows this spell may
use the Rider or Rider Within spells on
machines; note, however, that a
machine’s sensory apparatus may not
be readily intelligible to a human being!
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Reveal Function,
Locksmith, and Lightning.




Machine Speech/TL
Regular
Communicate with any machine
(of any IQ) in the machine’s own “language.” Unless the language is
sound-borne, the subject has to maintain physical contact with the
machine’s interface port or antenna.
The
amount
of
information
exchanged depends on the machine’s
intelligence; no machine below IQ 3
will be likely to know much of interest.
Each minute of the spell allows one
question and answer.
This is also a Communication and
Empathy spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Machine Summoning.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 1,200 for an item that talks to
one particular machine type, 5,000 for
an item that can talk to any machine.

Machine Summoning/TL
Regular
Call one machine of a named type
(anything under IQ 6). Range does not
matter for this spell. If the spell is successfully cast, the caster knows the
location of the closest machine of the
type and how long it will take for that
machine to come to him. It moves
towards the caster as fast as it can,
until the spell ends or the machine
reaches the immediate vicinity of the
caster.
Of course, the machine may not be
very good at finding its way, or it may
run out of fuel or power, etc. For
example, a TL7 refrigerator would be
unable to move at all. A TL7 car would
proceed in a straight line at top speed,
unaware of (and thus unable to avoid)
obstacles such as pedestrians, ditches,
lampposts . . .
Once the machine reaches the caster, it stays nearby, without attacking,
until the spell ends. The spell is broken
if the caster or one of his companions
attacks the machine.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Machine Control.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 500 for an item that summons one particular machine type,
1,000 for an item that can summon
any machine.



Glitch/TL
Regular; Resisted by HT
The machine equivalent of Spasm
(p. 35). This spell causes something to
go wrong for a moment with the subject machine. It may drop whatever it
was holding, eject a part, miss a cog in
its drive train, or garble a data packet.
Ingenious casters will find all sorts of
uses. The game effects can be anything from a trivial annoyance (if cast
on a flashlight, for instance), to potentially deadly (if cast on an automedic
in the middle of laser surgery).
Duration: An instant.
Cost: 3. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisite: Machine Control.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 300.

Malfunction/TL
Melee; Resisted by HT
The mechanical equivalent of Total
Paralysis. The subject machine simply
ceases to function for the duration of
the spell (an airplane falls, a sensor is
“blind,” and so on). The caster must
touch the subject.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5. Cannot be maintained;
must be recast.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Glitch.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 2,000.

Schematic/TL (VH)
Information
Creates detailed technical “blueprints” of the machine subject in the
caster’s mind. The caster can browse
through the mental schematic at his
leisure or the same rate that he could
examine actual hardcopy plans for the
machine. However, this spell grants no
appropriate skills; to interpret, for
instance, a schematic of a starship’s
fusion power plant, the caster would
need some skill in Engineering
(Fusion). To make any use of a
schematic of a weapon, either
Armoury or some sort of weapons
Engineering would be required. The
duration is the length of time that the
image stays with any useful clarity in
the caster’s mind. The caster must
touch the subject during the casting.
The schematic can either represent
the current state of the object (showing any internal damage, alterations,
and wear), or the ideal state of the
object, at the caster’s discretion. Both
can be useful. The latter use even gives
plans for an object based only on a
tiny fraction of it (at least 5% of the
machine’s total mass needs to be present). This could be used to form a
complete picture from a fragmented
Precursor device, for instance . . . In
either case, the cost to cast the spell is
based on the mass of the intact
machine.
The schematic image, even when
maintained by the mage, does not
count as a spell “on” for penalty
purposes.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 for a one-ton or smaller
object; add 1 energy to the cost for
each additional ton or fraction. Half
that to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Reveal Function and
History.

Item
Blueprint or headgear. Usable only
by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 200.

Rebuild/TL (VH)
Regular
This spell is an improved version of
Repair. It totally rebuilds any object,
from even a fragment. The caster must
first successfully cast Schematic on
the subject, and, while the schematic
is still in mind, begin casting Rebuild.
Schematic is unnecessary for simpler
objects. With enough power, you
could rebuild a starship from a scrap
of bulkhead!
The object re-forms at a rate of 500
pounds of missing mass per second,
beginning after the casting is completed. Thus, it would take a 30-ton tank
two minutes to completely rebuild
itself. Exotic materials may inflict a
skill penalty or slow the rebuilding
process.
On objects simpler than machines,
ignore the TL modifiers. Magic items
cannot be rebuilt.
This is also a Making and Breaking
spell.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 30 if the final mass will be
500 pounds or less; the object’s current
state of repair is not a factor. Add 1 to
cost for every additional 500 pounds
or fraction of final mass.
Time to cast: 1 second per point of
energy required.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Repair,
Create Object, and at least three spells
of each element. Schematic is
required to cast the spell on machines.

Animate Machine/TL (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Summons a spirit to animate a
machine the mage is touching.
Characters with the Machine metatrait (p. B263) can be affected by this
spell, though intelligent machines do
get a chance to resist.
The summoned spirit controls the
animated machine just as if it were
being operated in the normal fashion.
It also controls all the mechanical or
electronic accessories (including
weapons) built into the machine.
The spirit has DX 10 and IQ 9 with
the Automaton and Spirit meta-traits
(p. B263). It obeys the orders of the
caster or anyone the latter designates
– but the spirit takes all orders literally! “Drop me off” is a particularly
unfortunate command to give to an
animated helicopter. In such cases,
roll against the spirit’s IQ to see if it
uses the colloquial or literal meaning
of the phrase.
On a critical failure during casting,
a demon enters the machine. It then
attempts to kill its summoner and anyone else it can reach. The caster cannot dispel the demon animating the
machine – it uses its own 15 FP to
keep the spell going! In other respects,
the demon is similar to the spirits
ordinarily summoned.
Duration: One minute.
Cost: 8 for a machine of up to one
ton in mass, 9 for two tons or less, 10
for four tons, 11 for eight tons, 12 for
16 tons, and so on, with each extra
point of energy doubling the capable
mass of the spell. Half that to
maintain.
Time to cast: One second per energy
point.
Prerequisites: Machine Control and
either Animation or Animate Object.

Machine Possession/TL
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Animate Machine, except that
it is the caster’s own spirit which animates the machine. The machine
must have IQ 5 or less.
The caster animates the subject
just as if he was at its controls. He has
full access to the machine’s memories
and abilities; he may use all its skills
and abilities as though they were his
own. He may use his own mental abilities, but not his physical ones (so
spells cannot be cast unless they are
known so well that they require no
speech or gesture).
The spell allows the caster to keep
his own sensory apparatus in addition
to the machine’s; otherwise, he would
be severely handicapped, since
machines of TL6 or less are basically
blind and deaf.
The caster’s own body lies unconscious during the spell and should be
safeguarded.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Machine Control and
either Rider Within or Soul Rider.

Item
An pair of identical pieces of jewelry, one of silver, one of gold. The caster
wears the gold one, the machine bears
the silver one. The spell may then be
cast at any time, regardless of distance.
If a Powerstone is included, it is in the
gold one. If either item is broken, the
other loses its enchantment. Energy
cost to create: 1,500 (for the pair). Each
of the pair must include a synthetic
gemstone worth $200.

Permanent Machine Possession/TL (VH)
Regular; Resisted by Will
Like Machine Possession – but the
caster remains in the subject machine
until he chooses to leave or is exorcised by an appropriate spell (Dispel
Possession,
Remove
Curse,
Counterspell, etc). The caster’s body
remains in suspended animation
(p. 94) while the spell lasts. If the caster’s body dies, the spell is broken.
Whenever the subject machine takes
damage, the caster must roll on his
own body’s HT or take the same damage. If the subject machine “dies,” the
caster must roll vs. HT or die also!
In addition, the caster must roll
against his Will every day; a failed roll
means that he loses one point of IQ.
The caster does not need to roll any
more once he reaches the machine’s
normal IQ or Will range. The lost
attribute is regained when the spell is
ended. Should the caster’s IQ drop to
5, only Remove Curse or Dispel
Possession will end the spell.
Duration: Indefinite (could be permanent).
Cost: 30.
Time to cast: 5 minutes.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and
Machine Possession.

Awaken Computer/TL (VH)
Regular
Similar to Awaken Craft Spirit, this
spell awakens a computer’s spirit,
granting it awareness and sapience. If
the computer is already inhabited by a
sapient program, that program may
resist this spell; if it fails to resist, it is
rendered unconscious for the duration
of the spell.
The spirit awakened by the spell
has IQ equal to the computer’s
Complexity + 5. It has complete access
to all its host computer’s databases
and peripherals, though it cannot read
encrypted information in its host’s
databases. It can access networked
computers like any other being using
its host computer; it has Computer
Operation and Computer Programming at its IQ. It obeys the
caster’s orders faithfully, but otherwise
has free will (also, true to its nature, a
computer spirit can be infuriatingly
literal-minded).
Computer spirits often have quirky
personalities all their own. They
remember what happens each time
they are awakened; the time in
between awakenings is one of
slumber, not nonexistence.
If a critical failure is rolled the first
time a given computer is awakened, its
spirit is malicious and evil, and seeks
to do harm to the caster and anyone
else it can hurt. It has Computer
Hacking at a level equal to its host’s
Complexity; if nothing else, it erases
important data just because it can.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 8 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Animation and
Wisdom.

Item
A computer may be permanently
awakened for 100 times casting cost.

ENERGY SPELLS
For the purpose of these rules,
“power” means any energy used by a
machine to do its job. At TL8, this generally means electricity. Earlier TLs
might use mechanical power from a
waterwheel or steam engine; later TLs
might use exotic forms of beamed
power. “Fuel,” by contrast, means any
substance that is consumed to provide
power. Fuel takes many forms, from
wood to coal to antimatter. The TL of a
fuel or power source is determined by
the TLs at which people use it to operate
machines. If a fuel has more than one
TL, use the TL most favorable to the
caster when making calculations.
Many of the spells below require
conversions between standard power
sources and GURPS spell energy. The
default assumption is that one kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 10 energy;
thus, 360 kilowatts (kW) is equal to 1
energy/second, and 360 kilowatt-seconds (kWs) or kilojoules (kJ) is equal
to 1 energy. Some settings may have
different assumptions, however;
energy spells can become extremely
powerful in settings with antimatter
reactors, and the GM may want to
change the conversion rate to compensate.
purpose. The spell reveals nothing
about the substance’s chemistry or
stored energy, but it detects impurities, decay, and foreign objects that
might interfere with normal use. It
does not check fuel for magic.
Cost: 1 to test a single pound or gallon of fuel; 3 to check all the fuel in a
1-yard radius.

Item

Seek Power/TL
Information
Identifies the direction and approximate distance of the nearest significant source of power. Use the longdistance modifiers (p. 14). Any particular types or known sources of power
may be excluded if the caster specifically mentions them before beginning.
Power sources that are not currently being drawn from (a battery not
connected to a circuit, for example)
are harder to locate than power
sources in use; double the longdistance penalty.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.

Item
A wand that will point in the direction sought after and glow in proportion to the importance of the source
detected. Energy cost to create: 60.

Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 100.

Preserve Fuel/TL
Regular
Prevents fuel from spoiling, decaying, or otherwise becoming unusable.
Wood does not rot, gasoline does not
evaporate – even the radioactive decay
of nuclear fuels is suppressed!
Duration: 1 week.
Cost: 4 per pound of fuel. Half that
to maintain.
Prerequisite: Test Fuel.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy
cost to create: 400. (b) Chest or container; always on; the contents of the
chest are preserved indefinitely.
Energy cost to create: 40 for every
pound of fuel to be held (round up).

Purify Fuel/TL
Regular
Removes foreign objects and impurities from a fuel, rendering it fit to
use. If the fuel has been completely
corrupted by the impurities, the spell
will remove them . . . leaving nothing!
Cost: 1/2 per pound of material to
be purified (minimum cost of 1).
Prerequisite: Purify Water or Decay.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. The item
must touch the subject fuel. Energy
cost to create: 200.


Seek Fuel/TL
Information
Identifies the direction and approximate distance of the nearest
significant source of fuel. Use the
long-distance modifiers (p. 14). Any
particular types or known sources of
fuel may be excluded if the caster
specifically mentions them before
beginning.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.

Item
A thin graduated metal stick, which
will point in the direction sought after
and give an indication of the amount
detected. Energy cost to create: 60.

Test Fuel/TL
Information
Identifies if a substance can be
used normally as fuel for a specific


Create Fuel/TL
Regular
Turns any natural substance into
the primary solid or liquid fuel for the
spell’s TL. At TL5, this will turn rocks
into coal; at TL7, it would turn rocks
into uranium.
Other Energy spells such as Steal
Power or Draw Power cannot tap
magically created fuel or a machine
using created fuel for energy.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 per TL per pound; a TL5 fuel,
therefore, costs 5 energy per pound to
create. Minimum cost 1 per pound.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Seek Fuel and any
two transmutation spells.

Item
(a) Wand, staff, or jewelry; usable
only by a mage. The item must touch
the material to be turned into fuel.
Energy cost to create: 400. (b) A pot or
container that will change the contents
into solid fuel. Energy cost to create:
100 per pound of the daily capacity of
the container.

Essential Fuel/TL
Regular
Turns any regular fuel into the
magical essence of fuel. Essential Fuel
burns 10 times as long as regular fuel,
with one-third the usual pollution
(smoke, radiation, etc.). Vehicles running on Essential Fuel have 10 times
the Range; in a secret-magic setting,
this spell may give rise to urban legends about 200-mpg carburetors.
The increased potency of Essential
Fuel only applies when the Fuel is
used in a machine; hay treated with
Essential Fuel does nothing if fed to a
mule.
Other Energy spells such as Steal
Power or Draw Power cannot tap
Essential Fuel or a machine using
Essential Fuel for energy.
Duration: Permanent.
Cost: 1 per pound
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Any six Energy spells.

Stop Power
Area
Stops the flow of power in the area,
causing all powered devices to cease to
function. This may or may not cause
permanent damage to the devices,
depending on their design. Barring
this, any affected device works
normally when it leaves the area.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 3 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Seek
Power.

Item
Wand or staff, usable only by a
mage. Energy cost to create: 800.

Lend Power/TL
Regular
The caster expends energy to magically power a device. In theory, a large
enough circle of mages could use this
spell to power a starship and its
weapons.
The spell cannot be used to directly
charge batteries or other storage
devices. It could, however, power a
machine designed to recharge them . . .
Duration: Indefinite.
Cost: The GM will have to convert
the device’s power requirement into
an energy rate equivalent (see pp. 178179). Minimum energy cost is one per
hour; high skill does not reduce cost.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Seek
Power.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages; the item must touch the
subject. Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b)
Any device can be enchanted so that
any mage willing to lend it power (possibly in addition to its normal power
source) can do so. The mage need not
know the spell; the enchantment supplies the magic. The enchanted device
will also accept a Powerstone or
Maintain Spell. Energy cost to create: 1
per 100 pounds of device mass (round
up); the minimum cost is 250.

Propel/TL
Regular
Uses magical energy to operate any
device that converts power or fuel into
motion, from a lawn mower to a
stardrive. In almost all cases, these
devices are vehicles of some sort; see
Vehicles, p. B462, for more details.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: Multiply vehicle Lwt. (in
tons) by the desired Move (up to the
vehicle’s Top Speed), then divide by
the caster’s skill. Minimum cost is 1
energy; high skill does not reduce
casting cost. Same cost to maintain.
Example: A mage with Propel/TL7-15 wishes to move his sports car
(p. B464) at its top speed of Move 75
(150 mph). The car weighs 1.8 tons. To
move the car at Move 75 for the duration of the spell requires (1.8¥75)/15 = 9
energy.
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable
only by mages; the item must touch
the subject. Energy cost to create:
1,000. (b) Any engine can be enchanted so that any mage willing to propel
it can do so. The mage need not know
the spell; the enchantment supplies
the magic. The enchanted device will
also accept a Powerstone or Maintain
Spell. Energy cost to create: 20 per ton
of vehicle Lwt. (round up); minimum
cost is 200.
Prerequisites: Create Fuel and
Dancing Object.

Conduct Power/TL (VH)
Special
Turns the caster into a power conduit, a link between an active power
source and a device in need of it. The
spell has two “subjects”: the source
and the sink. The range penalty is
based on the total distance from
source to caster plus caster to sink. If
either the source or the sink is not visible to the caster, the roll is at -5; if
neither is visible, the roll is at -10!
A device may draw power through
one mage or circle of mages at a time; if
several mages are competing to supply
a device, roll a Quick Contest of Skill
between casters, adjusting for range.
The maximum power a mage may
safely serve as a conduit for is (HT) ¥
(Magery squared)/4, in megawatts.
Thus, a wizard with HT 10 and
Magery 2 could handle a steady
stream of 10¥(2¥2)/4, or 10
megawatts, safely. If a mage’s safe level
is exceeded, every second he must take
1 fatigue per excess MW (or fraction
thereof) and roll vs. HT. On a failed
roll, he loses HP equal to the fatigue
loss for that turn. On a critical failure,
he suffers a heart attack (see Mortal
Conditions, p. B429) and collapses.
A source for this spell need not be a
source of electricity or some other
energetic essence; particularly in its
low-TL versions, Conduct Power may
tap into mechanical energy from
natural sources. However, a power
source must be in a form that could be
directly used by a machine; thus, a
water wheel would be a viable source,
but a waterfall would not be.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: None to cast. 1 to maintain
(due to the strain of the power’s passage). This maintenance cost isn’t
reduced by high skill.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Seek
Power.
Example: The spell could be cast on
the fusion plant in a starship (the
source) and a blaster pistol in the
mage’s hand (the sink). While the spell
is maintained, the fusion plant powers
the pistol. If the blaster is in the mage’s
hand and the plant is 3 yards beneath
the catwalk he is standing on, the total
distance is 3 yards, for a -3 range penalty. If the catwalk obscures the mage’s
view of the power plant, he is at a further -5 (note that the caster need not be
looking at the power plant while firing
the gun – just while casting the spell!).

Steal Power/TL (VH)
Regular
The caster steals power from a
stored power source (such as a battery)
to restore his FP.
Cost: The caster regains energy at a
percentage efficiency equal to his skill
with the spell; a caster with skill 15,
draining a battery completely, would
himself gain 15% of the power potential contained in the battery (or less, if
less would completely restore the caster’s FP). The rest of the power in the
battery is wasted.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Minor
Healing, and Conduct Power.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Usable only
by a mage. The mage and the item
must both touch the source. Energy
cost to create: 1,000.

Draw Power/TL (VH)
Special
Identical to Conduct Power, except
that the subject is a spell; a wizard with
HT 10 and Magery 2 could use a 10 MW
fusion plant to provide him with a
steady stream of 28 energy per second
to power his magic! The Draw Power
must be cast first and counts as a spell
“on” when casting the subject spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: None to cast. 1 to maintain
(due to the strain of the power’s passage). This maintenance cost is not
reduced by high skill.
Prerequisites: Steal Power and at
least two spells from 10 different
colleges.

Magnetic Vision
Regular
Reveals magnetic fields to the subject. They are brightest where densest
and seem to flow from one magnetic
pole to the other. If the subject has
Physics/TL6 or higher at a skill of 12
or more, he can use it to estimate the
strength of the magnetic field. If no
magnetic object stronger than a
kitchen magnet is within 1 yard of
him, the subject can determine magnetic north. Combined with 1,000¥
Microscopic Vision (p. B68), the
subject can directly read magnetic
data storage media (each format is a
distinct language, which must be
known at Native level to read in real
time).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Keen Vision.

Item
Jewelry or spectacles. The item must
include a small magnet. Only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 150.

Radio Hearing
Regular
The subject can “tune” his hearing
to the radio and microwave portions
of the electromagnetic spectrum, as if
he had Telecommunication (Radio)
(Receive Only, -50%) (p. B91).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisite: Keen Hearing.

Item
Jewelry (earrings are particularly
appropriate). Only affects the wearer.

Energy cost to create: 150. Some
enchanters create items (conchs, or
small radios or earplugs, typically) that
turn the radio signal into an audible
one; the user tunes it by concentrating.

Spectrum Vision (VH)
Regular
The subject can perceive any portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum, as if
he had Hyperspectral Vision with the
Extended Low-Band and Extended
High-Band enhancements (p. B60). The
GM may require rolls against various
scientific skills to allow the subject to
understand what he sees.

create: 750.

See Radiation
Regular
Makes all radioactive items visible in
the subject’s field of vision. Each such
item glows in proportion to its activity.
Items hidden under clothes, behind
walls, etc, give off a glow depending on
the amount of radiation getting
through the shielding. Spells such as
Radiation Jet also become visible.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.



Irradiate
Area
Makes an area radioactive.

spells and two Fire spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 300.

Seek Radiation
Information
Identifies the direction and approximate distance of the nearest significant
source of radiation of any sort. The

specifies them before casting. Use the
long-distance modifiers (p. 14).
Cost: 3.

Regular
The subject (person, creature or
object) and anything he carries
becomes resistant to radiation. This is
expressed in terms of Protection
Factor (see p. B436).
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 for PF 10, 2 for PF 100, 3 for
PF 1,000. Half that (round up) to
maintain.
Prerequisites: At least three
Radiation spells.

Item
(a) Any; only affects the wearer.
Energy cost to create: 1,000. (b) Wand,
staff, or jewelry. Energy cost to create:
1,500.

Cure Radiation (VH)
Regular
Heals the subject of radiation damage; this spell reduces the inherent
radiation dose in the subject’s body,
including the 10% “permanent”
retained dose (the permanent dose,
however, is the last to be healed). It
does not restore already-lost HP or
other injury, which must be healed by
other means.
This is also a Healing spell.
Duration: The dose is cured
permanently.
Cost: 1 per 10 rads removed from
the subject’s body; minimum cost 5.
Time to cast: 30 seconds.
Prerequisites: Resist Radiation and
Major Healing.

Item
Wand or staff. The item must touch
the subject. Usable only by a mage or a
nonmage with Physician 20 or higher.
Energy cost to create: 1,500.

Radiation Jet
Regular
Shoot an invisible beam of radiation
from one finger. Each turn, the caster
rolls versus DX-4 or Innate Attack skill
to hit. This attack may be dodged or
blocked (though only shields which are
impervious to radiation will be any
use), but not parried. The jet inflicts 10
rads per point of energy in the spell to a
human-sized target.
The spell can also fog photographic
films, scramble electronics, and so on.

Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. Range in yards is equal
to energy cost. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisites: Irradiate and Resist
Radiation.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The jet issues from the item’s
tip. Energy cost to create: 600.

Breathe Radiation (VH)
Regular
Similar to Radiation Jet, except
that the radiation issues from the caster’s mouth and it cannot be maintained. Caster rolls to hit against DX-4
or Innate Attack skill. This counts as
an action; the caster must be facing
his target. No hand gestures are
required to cast this spell; certain lip
and tongue motions are made instead.
Thus Breathe Radiation can be cast
“no hands” at any level of skill.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Radiation Jet.

Item
Jewelry. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 1,200.

Information
Identifies a metal’s type. The caster
must touch the metal to be identified.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Seek Earth.


Seek Plastic
Information
Identifies the direction and approximate distance of the nearest significant
quantity of plastic. Use the long-distance modifiers (p. 14). Any particular
types or known quantities of plastic

must touch the plastic to be identified.
Useful for sorting recyclables.
Cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Seek Plastic.

Shape Metal
Regular
Move solid and liquid metal about
and shape it into any form. If the form
is stable, it remains permanently after
shaping. An unstable form lasts only
while the spell continues – though no
special concentration is required – and
then breaks and collapses. A successful
Architecture roll may be required to
create a stable arch, overhang or other
structure. Solid metal moved with this
spell travels at Move 1/2; liquid metal
flows at that speed uphill, but goes
much faster horizontally (Move 4) or
downhill (up to Move 10).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 (4 for soft metals such as
lead, gold or magnesium). Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and either
Shape Earth or at least six Tech spells.

Shape Plastic
Regular
Similar to Shape Metal, but affects
“plastic.” Material moved with this
spell travels at Move 1/2 or faster if
ductile or liquid.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 6 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and either
Shape Plant or at least six Tech spells.

(lead) resist or block this spell outright.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 30 seconds.
Cost: 2 per 5 yards of depth (maximum 50 yards) to cast. Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Metal.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 2,500.

Seek Water
Information
Determines the direction, distance,
and general nature of the nearest
significant source of
water. Use the longdistance modifiers
(p. 14). Any known
sources of water
may be excluded if
the caster specifically mentions them
before beginning.
Requires a forked
stick; roll at -3 if this
is not available.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Seek Water.

Purify Water
Special
Remove all impurities from water
by pouring it through any hoop or ring
(or, in a pinch, his own fingers) into a
container. Only one skill roll is
required, as long as the flow continues.
Duration: Purified water stays pure
unless recontaminated.
Cost: 1 per gallon purified.
Time to cast: Usually 5 to 10 seconds per gallon, unless a large
container and ring are used.
Prerequisite: Seek Water.
Cost: 2.

Item
A forked stick
(may also be carved
of bone or ivory).
Cost to create: 40
energy and $300 in
spell materials.

Seek Coastline
Information
Tells a caster at sea the direction
and approximate distance of the nearest coastline. Use long-distance modifiers (p. 14). Any known coastline,
such as that of a nearby island, may
be excluded if the caster specifically
mentions it during casting.
Cost: 3.
Time to cast: 10 seconds. Prerequisite: Seek Water.

Item
A hoop of bone or ivory. Energy
cost to create: 50.

Create Water
Regular
Creates pure water out of nothing.
This water may appear in any of
several forms. It may appear within a
container, or as a globe in midair (it
falls immediately). Or it may appear as
a dense mist of droplets; in this form,
one gallon of water will extinguish all
fires in a one-yard radius. Water cannot be created inside a foe to drown
him!
Duration: The created water is permanent.
Cost: 2 per gallon created.
Prerequisite: Purify Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 200.

Destroy Water
Area
Causes water (in any form) to vanish, leaving a vacuum – or perhaps
specks of dry impurities. If more water
is all around, it will rush in to fill the
hole. Good for drying things out, saving
a drowning victim, etc. Cannot be used
as a “dehydrating” attack on a foe.
Duration: Permanent.
Base cost: 3. In deep water, the area
is only 2 yards in height (or depth).
Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Create Water.

Item
Wand, staff, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 300.

Icy Weapon
Regular
Causes any weapon to become
freezing cold. This does not harm the
user or the weapon, but an attack with
the weapon will do +2 damage to most
foes if it penetrates DR. Multiply this
bonus for any Vulnerability (p. B161)
to ice or cold. Add this bonus to the
final injury inflicted by the attack – for
instance, an “impaling” icy attack is
still only good for +2 damage, not +4.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Create Water.

Item
A weapon that becomes freezing
cold whenever wielded, at no energy
cost to the user. Cost to create: 750
energy, $2,000 spell materials.

Shape Water
Regular
Sculpt water (including ice or
steam) into any form, and even move
it about. Once given a shape, the water
holds it without further concentration
until the spell ends. Water moved with
this spell travels at Move 3.
A useful shape is a wall of water to
stop fiery attacks – 20 gallons make a
wall 2 yards high ¥ 1 yard wide. This
stops Fireball spells and ordinary fire.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 1 per 20 gallons shaped.
Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Create Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 400.

Umbrella
Regular
Walk in any slight precipitation
without getting wet. An invisible
“shield” is seen to deflect incoming
raindrops. Umbrella does not work
against intense (or magical) hail, rains
of stones or frogs, etc.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 10 minutes.
Cost: 1.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Water or Shield.

Item

(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only
affects the wearer. A severe drawback
is that, as soon as it is activated, the
item falls through the user’s hand –
thus a spell cast with this item lasts
only a minute. Energy cost to create:
1,200. (b) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only
affects the wearer. Unlike the previous
item, this item turns aqueous along
with the wearer, allowing him to maintain the spell for longer than a minute.
While aqueous, the item loses any
magical powers it might ordinarily
have. Energy cost to create: 2,500.

Foul Water
Area
Renders water undrinkable. Foul
water is readily recognizable by its
uninviting color and smell, whereas
fouled beer or wine may be more difficult to detect. Anyone foolish enough
to drink it must make a HT roll. On a
successful roll, he merely feels sick
and loses 2 HP. On a failed roll, he is
seized by painful stomach cramps,
losing 1d+1 HP; he is at -3 for all skills
until the lost HP are restored.
Foul water also fails to satisfy
thirst, and cannot support fish or
other water-dwellers (a fish of any sort
slowly suffocates in fouled water; a
sea-mammal becomes ill from ingesting it). In a body of water, the foul
water is eventually diluted to harmlessness; if cast in a mountain stream,
for instance, this spell effectively lasts
only a second or two.
Base cost: 3.
Prerequisites: Purify Water and
Decay.

Item

Jewelry. Always on. Only affects the
wearer. Cost to create: 100 energy.

Staff or wand. The item must touch
the subject water. Energy cost to create:
100.

Body of Water
Regular; Resisted by HT
Temporarily grants the subject the
Body of Water meta-trait (p. B262).
Clothes (up to 6 pounds) become
liquid along with him, while other
possessions drop to the ground.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.


Freeze
Regular
Turns water into solid ice. The ice
retains the shape of its container; in
open water, the affected volume
freezes as a sphere or cube, at the caster’s option. A Shape Water spell may
be cast to form the water before it is
frozen, or to alter the shape of the ice
after it is frozen.
Duration: The ice lasts until it
melts naturally.
Cost: 2 for an object up to the size
of a fist, 4 for up to a cubic foot, 6 for
a cubic yard, 3 more for each additional cubic yard. If the temperature is
above freezing, the caster may maintain the spell by expending the casting
cost once every 10 minutes.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to
create: 200 energy, $100 blue gem.


Ice Slick
Area
Covers the floor or ground with a
quarter-inch sheet of clear ice. Footing
on this ice slick is very precarious. All
close combat and melee attacks, and
all active defenses, are at -3 on an ice
slick. Other physical skills, including
missile and thrown weapon attacks,
are at -2. Even walking across an ice
slick is usually difficult – in general,
anyone attempting to walk or run
across an ice slick must roll against
DX-2 for every yard of distance he covers. If he fails this roll, he falls to the
ice. He may, with another DX-2 roll,
attempt to stand on his next turn.
Spiked footwear negates all penalties
on ice.
Ice slicks are very difficult to see.
Anyone not actively watching the
ground for ice must make a roll
against IQ-3 to notice an ice slick
before stepping onto it.
An ice slick will extinguish an area
of normal fire that it overlaps, and vice
versa.
Duration: An ice slick lasts until it
melts naturally.
Base cost: 3.
Time to cast: 2 seconds per yard of
radius.
Prerequisite: Frost.

Item
(a) Rug or mat. Cost per 10 square
feet: 100 energy, $250 spell materials.

(b) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Cost to
create: 250 energy, $500 blue gem.

Ice Sphere
Missile
Throw a ball of ice from your hand.
When it strikes, it does crushing damage and vanishes in a gout of water. A
1-die Ice Sphere can also extinguish
fire in a 1-yard radius, if accurately
aimed. It has 1⁄2D 40, Max 80, Acc 2.
Cost: Any amount up to your
Magery level per second, for 3 seconds. The sphere does 1d damage per
point of energy.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Staff or wand – the ball is fired
from the end of the item. Usable only
by a mage. Energy cost to create: 400;
the staff or wand must be tipped by a
$500 sapphire.

Icy Missiles
Regular
Like Icy Weapon, but cast on a missile weapon. The weapon itself
becomes cold to the touch, but won’t
harm the wielder. Any missile it fires
becomes freezing cold, doing +2 damage to most foes; it shatters after it hits
a target or after 10 seconds, whichever
comes first.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Icy Weapon.

Item
A missile weapon that fires icy missiles whenever used, at no energy cost
to the user. Energy cost to create: 1,000;
a $500 sapphire must be set in the
weapon.

Melt Ice
Area
Turns solid ice into water.
Duration: Permanent above freezing; 10 minutes below freezing.
Base cost: 1 (minimum 2). Below
freezing, the cost to maintain is the
same.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Heat or Freeze.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 300 energy, $100 spell materials.

Resist Water
Regular
The subject (person, creature, or
object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of
dampness, remaining dry even if completely submerged. The spell protects
against the dampening effect of steam
or ice, but not against the scalding or
freezing itself! This also protects
against water-like substances; a spilled
drink does not stain, for instance. Its
protection against acid is limited – the
subject is granted 2 points of DR
against acid spills or immersion.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Either Shape Water
and Destroy Water, or Umbrella.

Item
(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Always
on. Only affects the wearer. Cost to create: 200 energy and a $200 emerald.
(b) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to
create: 400 energy and a $200 emerald.

Snow Shoes
Regular
Cross ice or snow as though it were
regular ground. Snow Shoes eliminates any movement, DX, or skill
penalties normally assessed for ice or
snow. The subject is still subject to
penalties caused by an unstable surface, such as a rocking ice floe or an
avalanche.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Shoes, boots, or sandals. Only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 350.

Walk on Water
Regular
Walk on water as with the Walk on
Liquid advantage (p. B97).
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 3 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 4 seconds.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Staff, wand, jewelry, or clothing.
Only affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 500.

Water Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin jet of water from one
finger. Each turn, the caster rolls vs.
DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit. This
attack may be dodged or blocked, but
not parried. It does knockback to all
targets, and damage to creatures of
flame; it can kill or knock down flying
swarm creatures. It can extinguish a 1yard-radius area of normal fire.
Anyone hit in the face by a Water Jet is
at a -3 penalty to combat skills next
turn for each point of energy put into
the jet.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. Does 1d damage for
each point put into it. Range is equal
to the number of dice.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. If the item is a wand or
staff, it must have a blue tip (or a bluejeweled tip); the jet comes from the
tip. Energy cost to create: 600.

Whirlpool
Area
Create a circular whirlpool in a
body of water (lakes, rivers, seas, but
also ponds and pools). By concentrating, the caster can move the Whirlpool
any distance up to its own diameter
per second. The caster may move at
half speed while concentrating.
The whirlpool has a “funnel” in its
center, the radius of which (at the surface) may be up to half that of the
whirlpool. The depth of the funnel may
be up to twice the radius of the
whirlpool. The funnel gets progressively narrower as one nears its bottom.
The outermost yard of the
whirlpool moves at Move 1, the next
inner ring at Move 2 and so on.
Anyone caught in the whirlpool will be
dragged towards its bottom; a
Swimming roll, at a penalty equal to
the current ring’s speed, must be made
every revolution to avoid being
dragged into the next inner ring (in
addition to the usual consequences for
failure – p. B354). A success by 3 or
more means the swimmer managed to
move outward one ring (if he so wills).
The whirlpool has little effect on
beings and objects weighing more
than 90 pounds times its radius in
yards. While in the whirlpool, all DXbased skills (except aquatic ones such
as Swimming or Scuba) are at -5,
above and beyond any penalty for
being in water in the first place.
Duration: 1 minute after reaching
full strength.
Base cost: 2 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Time to cast: The Whirlpool starts
immediately, but the caster must concentrate for a number of seconds
equal to the Whirlpool’s radius in
yards to bring it to full strength. The
Whirlpool takes a like time to stop
once the spell lapses, although no
concentration is required.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Cost to create: 200 energy
and a $500 emerald.

Coolness
Regular
The subject remains comfortably
cool in warm weather, avoiding the
risk of dehydration or heat stroke –
but not sunburn! Effectively, the subject gains Temperature Tolerance 3
(p. B93) toward heat for the duration
of the spell. The spell offers no protection against actual flame or fire-based
attack spells.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Cold.

Item
Clothing, staff, or jewelry; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to
create: 200.

Water Vision
Information
See through water, snow, and ice –
to find sunken treasure, lurking
monsters, etc.
This is also a Knowledge spell.
Duration: 30 seconds.
Cost: 1 per 20 yards of depth to cast
(up to 200 yards). Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Item
Any. Energy cost to create: 200.

Create Ice
Regular
Creates a quantity of ice or snow. It
may appear as: a solid block of any
shape; within a container (which must
be large enough); hanging in mid-air
(it falls immediately); as a mass of ice
shavings (great for cooling drinks); or
as a cloud of snow (which settles to
the ground). It takes 60 gallons of ice
shavings or snow to put out a one-yard
radius area of fire within one second.
A gallon of snow, depending on its
fluffiness (p. 195), will cover a oneyard-radius area to a depth of two to
18 inches.
Duration: Permanent; the ice lasts
until it melts naturally.
Cost: 2 per gallon of ice created.
Prerequisite: Freeze.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 200 energy and a $100 sapphire.

Dehydrate
Regular; Resisted by HT
Removes the water from a subject’s
tissues, causing damage or death.
Affects the whole victim if cast from a
distance; if the caster touches the subject, damage is limited to the part
touched. Armor does not protect!
Duration: Damage done is permanent until healed.
Cost: 1 per 1d-1 damage done, up
to 3.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite:s At least five Water
spells, including Destroy Water.

Item
Wand or staff. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. Cost to create: 700 energy and
$1,000 in spell materials.

Ice Dagger
Missile
Create and hurl a razor-sharp icicle. When it strikes, it does impaling
damage and melts instantly. It has
1⁄2D 30, Max 60, Acc 3.
Cost: Any amount up to your
Magery level per second, for 3 seconds. Does 1d-1 impaling damage for
each point of energy put into it. No
extra effect on creatures of fire.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Ice Sphere or Water
Jet.

Item
Jewelry; the item must have a dagger shape or design. Usable only by a
mage. Energy cost to create: 400.

Icy Touch
Melee
Covers the subject with a coating of
ice. The caster must touch the subject
to trigger this spell; hit location is
irrelevant. The subject is immobilized
and may take no action until he
breaks through the ice with a successful ST roll at a -1 penalty for every 1/4”
of ice. The ice can be chipped off from
the outside at a rate of 1/4” of ice for
every point of basic damage; it has DR
1 per 1/2” of ice. If rescuers are not
careful, however, they may smash
through the ice to injure the subject
(see Overpenetration, p. B408).
While encased in ice, the subject is
vulnerable to thermal shock (p. B430);
he must roll vs. HT immediately. On a
success, he loses 1 FP; on a failure, he
loses FP equal to the margin of failure.
The HT roll must be repeated every
minute that the subject remains
encased in ice. If the situation
becomes dire enough that the subject
must start making death checks, a
critical success means that the subject
has fallen into suspended animation,
as per the spell.
Duration: Permanent. If the temperature is above the freezing point,
the ice coating may be maintained by
spending as much energy as in the
original casting every 10 minutes.
Cost: 2 per 1/4” of ice; must affect
the entire subject, not just a part of it!
Every 1/4” will inflict 1d-1 of damage
to flame creatures.
Time to cast: 1 second per 1/4” of
ice.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
four Water spells.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. The item’s tip must be white.
Energy cost to create: 800.

Walk Through Water
Regular
Pass through water or ice as if it
were air; the subject can walk through
glaciers, along the bottoms of lakes,
etc. Like the Swim spell, this negates
combat penalties for fighting in water.
In liquid water, the subject requires a
surface to walk on. The spell may cost
more if resistance to high pressures is
necessary. The spell neither opens a
passage so that others can follow, nor
reveals what is on the other side . . . If
the caster (or the subject) knows a
spell to let him breathe, the subject
will have no difficulty breathing during his journey, at no energy cost.
Otherwise, he must hold his breath!
Should the spell end before the
subject regains the open air, he finds
himself submerged. He is not
automatically harmed, but drowns (or
suffocates, if in ice) if he cannot
escape.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 4 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and Shape
Water.

Item
Clothing or jewelry; only affects the
wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,100.

Dry Spring
Regular
Dries and blocks the waterflow
within a spring, reducing its output.
Duration: Permanent. Note, however, that the local geology may eventually shift, restoring the spring’s output to its previous level.
Cost: 3 times the reduction in the
spring’s output, in gallons per hour.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Destroy Water and
Shape Earth.

Item
Staff. Cost to create: 450 energy and
a $500 emerald.

Essential Water
Regular
Like Create Water, but the water
created is the magical essence of
water. It extinguishes any type of fire
in the same proportion that ordinary
water extinguishes ordinary fire. It is
also three times as thirst-quenching as
ordinary water – in other words, a
mere quart of Essential Water will
keep someone hydrated for a full day
of exertion in hot climates (p. B426).
Duration: Permanent until used; if
it is used to put out a fire, for instance,
the steam created is ordinary water.
Cost: 3 per gallon created.
Prerequisite: At least 6 other Water
spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by a mage. Energy cost to create: 800.

Frostbite
Regular; Resisted by HT
Lowers the temperatures in the
body tissues of the subject, causing
damage or death. Affects the whole
victim if cast from a distance; if cast
by touch, damage is limited to the part
touched. Armor does not protect.
Duration: Damage is permanent
until healed.
Cost: 1 per die of damage done, up
to 3.
Time to cast: 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Frost and Freeze.

Item
Wand or staff. Usable only by
mages; the item must touch the subject. Cost to create: 700 energy, $500
spell materials, and a $500 blue gem.

Snow Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin jet of snow from one
finger. Each turn, the caster rolls versus DX-4 or Innate Attack skill to hit.
This attack may be dodged or blocked,
but not parried. It does knockback on
all targets and damage to creatures of
flame; it can kill or knock down flying
swarm creatures. It can extinguish
normal fire within an area one yard in
radius. If the spell strikes the target’s
face, it temporarily blinds him unless
he makes a HT roll.
If the HT roll is failed, each energy
point in the spell blinds the target for
one second. After the target can see
again, blurry vision will put him at a -3
penalty to combat skills for a further
1d seconds. On a critically failed HT
roll, the target is blinded for 1d seconds per point of energy in the spell.
On a successful HT roll, the victim
covers his eyes and is therefore unable
to see for one second. On a critical
success, the victim is unaffected.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. The jet does 1d of
knockback for every point put into it.
Its range is equal to the number of
dice. The cost to maintain is the same.
Prerequisites: Water Jet and Freeze.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The jet issues from the item’s
tip. Energy cost to create: 600; the staff
or wand must be tipped by a $500
sapphire.

Breathe Water
Regular
Allows the subject to breathe water
as though it were air, temporarily
granting Doesn’t Breathe (Gills)
(p. B49). The subject does not lose the
ability to breathe ordinary air! At the
GM’s discretion, this spell may also
include the equivalent of Pressure
Support 1 (p. B77), allowing the subject to venture into deep water without
concern.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 4 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Create Air and
Destroy Water.

Body of Ice (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
Temporarily grants the subject the
Body of Ice meta-trait (p. B262).
Clothes (up to 6 pounds) also become
ice, but lose any magic powers they
might have had.
Duration: 1 minute. Expires if the
subject loses consciousness.
Cost: 7 to cast. 3 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Body of
Water, and Freeze.

Item
Staff, wand. or jewelry. Only affects
the wearer. Energy cost to create: 1,300.

Boil Water
Regular
Turns water into steam. Water
expands considerably in going from liquid to gas; a mere pint of water makes a
lot of steam. The scalding effect of
steam is such that a steam hex should
be treated exactly as a fire hex, except
that it cannot ignite anything.
Duration: Permanent, though the
steam will recondense naturally (within about 10 minutes).
Cost: 2 for a fist-sized quantity of
water (makes about a hex of steam), 4
for a cubic foot’s worth (makes about 40
cubic yards of steam), 6 for a square
yard of water to a foot’s depth (makes
about 400 cubic yards of steam), 3 for
each additional third of a cubic yard.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: Shape Water and
Heat.

Item

Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 200 energy and a $100 carnelian.

Clothing or jewelry. Energy cost to
create: 400.

Condense Steam
Area
Turns
steam into
room-temperature water.
Duration: Permanent, though the
water may boil again.
Base cost: 1 (minimum 2).
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisite: Cold or Boil Water.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to
create: 300 energy and a $100 emerald.

Create Acid
Regular
Creates a strong acidic solution out
of nothing. It may appear in any of
several forms. It may appear within a
container (which should be of glass or
of some special stone or metal if the
acid is not to attack it), as a globe in
mid-air (which falls immediately), or
as a dense mist of droplets (which
inflicts splashing damage).
Duration: The created acid is permanent, but is neutralized as it reacts
with objects and beings.
Cost: 4 per gallon created.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Create Water and
Create Earth.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 300.

Create Spring
Regular
Increases a spring’s output, or
creates one where none exists.
Duration: Permanent. Note, however, that the local geology may
eventually shift, reducing the spring’s
output to its previous level.
Cost: 5 times the increase in the
spring’s output, in gallons per hour.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: Dry Spring and
Shape Water.

Item
Staff. Cost to create: 675 energy and
a $500 emerald.


Flesh to Ice (VH)
Regular; Resisted by HT
“Petrifies” a living subject (and all
his gear!) into ice. Stone to Flesh can
reverse the effects of this spell, but the caster is at a -4 penalty unless he also knows Flesh to Ice. Remove Curse can also break the spell.
Duration:
Permanent
until
reversed by another spell or substantial melting (or breakage) takes place.
Cost: 12 to cast; must affect the
entire subject, not just a part of it!
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Frostbite,
and Body of Water.


(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry; only
affects the wearer. Energy cost to create: 800. (b) Staff, wand, or jewelry.
Energy cost to create: 1,200.

Create Steam
Area
Produces a cloud of steam. Until it
dissipates, anyone standing within the
area of effect is at risk of scalding (treat
as if surrounded by fire, pp. B443-444,
except that steam cannot set anything
aflame). The steam tends to rise; the
rate of dissipation depends on the
area, ambient temperature and the
presence of wind – indoors, it usually
lasts until the spell expires, but outdoors on a windy or cold day it may
last only 10 seconds or so.
Duration: 5 minutes or less, as
above.
Base cost: 2 to cast. Cannot be
maintained.
Prerequisite: Boil Wat


Geyser (VH)
Area
Causes a geyser of scalding-hot
water to gush forth from the ground.
It creates a hole equal to its radius, as
set by the caster. All those within the
geyser suffer 3d damage. They are
automatically pushed out of the area
of effect, and must make a DX-5 roll to
stay afoot!
Two seconds after the geyser starts,
the water begins to fall back as spray.
Under normal conditions, it affects an
area double the radius of the original
geyser. All those within this new spray
area suffer 1d damage per second.
Example: A geyser of 2 yards radius
is created. All those in that area suffer
3d damage. Two seconds later, all
those within 4 yards, but not within 2
yards, suffer 1d of damage.
If the caster is in the geyser area, he
takes normal damage, but if he is in
the spray area, he is unharmed.
The geyser must always spring
from the earth; it would not work on a
rooftop. If cast under unusual circumstances, it can produce interesting
effects, such as a continuing stream of
scalding water flowing downhill at
foes, but these must be controlled by
the GM.
Duration: 1 second.
Base cost: 5 to cast. 2 to maintain.
Time to cast: 5 seconds.
Prerequisites: Six Water spells,
including Create Spring, and either
four Earth spells or four Fire spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 400 energy and a $100 carnelian.

Resist Acid
Regular
The subject (person, creature or
object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of acid.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast; 6 if subject must
resist Essential Acid. Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Create Acid.



Steam Jet
Regular
Shoot a thin jet of scalding steam
from one finger. Each turn, the caster
rolls versus DX-4 or Innate Attack skill
to hit. This attack may be dodged or
blocked, but not parried. It does
knockback on all targets in addition to
its regular damage; it does double
damage to creatures of flame or ice. It
can extinguish normal fire within an
area 1 yard in radius. If the spell
strikes the target’s face, it temporarily
blinds him unless he makes a HT roll.
If the HT roll is failed, each energy
point in the spell blinds the target for
one second. After the target can see
again, blurry vision will put him at a -3
penalty to combat skills for a further 1d
seconds. On a critically failed HT roll,
the target is blinded for 1d seconds per
point of energy in the spell. On a successful HT roll, the victim covers his
eyes for one second and is therefore
unable to see for one turn. On a critical
success, the victim is unaffected.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. Does 1d-1 of scalding
damage for every point put into it.
Range is equal to the number of dice.
Cost to maintain is the same.
Prerequisites: Water Jet and Boil
Water.


Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The jet issues from the item’s
tip. Energy cost to create: 700; the staff
or wand must be tipped by a $300
carnelian.


Small Water Elemental
This is the basic water elemental summoned by casting Summon
Water Elemental at the minimum energy cost of 4. More energy put into
the spell summons a more powerful elemental. Usually, this simply means
a larger elemental; one point of energy is equal to 1 additional point of ST,
5 HP, or 2 points of DR. However, the GM may choose to build a more
exotic elemental, adding unusual traits to the following template, or
working one up from scratch.

Small Water Elemental
40 points
Attribute Modifiers: ST-3 [-30]; DX-2 [-40]; IQ-3 [-60]; HT-2 [-20].
Secondary Characteristic Modifiers: SM -1.
Advantages: Amphibious [10]; Chameleon 1 [5]; Doesn’t Breathe [20];
Doesn’t Sleep [20]; Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards [30]; Injury
Tolerance (Diffuse) [100];
Pressure Support 3 [15];
Slippery 5 [10].
Disadvantages: Invertebrate [-10];
Vulnerability
(Dehydration)
[-10].



Rain of Acid
Area
Droplets of acid rain from the sky
onto the area, causing 1d-1 acid damage per second to all within it.
Characters and creatures under the
rain of acid take damage on their own
turns; if less than an entire second is
spent in the affected area, damage is
halved (round down).
The spell can only be cast out of
doors. Armor protects in the usual
fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the
droplets, but it may take damage
(p. B484). This requires two hands
and a Ready action, and succeeds
automatically in protecting the character once the shield is readied
upwards, but this unreadies the shield
from its normal protective functions!
In addition, acid rain eats objects
away at the rate of 1 HP every 10 seconds; the object’s DR protects it completely for 3 seconds per DR. This
includes buildings.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 3. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Create
Water, and Create Earth.



Item
Staff. Usable only by mages. Energy
cost to create: 1,200.

Missile
Throw a ball of acid from one
hand. When it strikes something, it
bursts, inflicting acid damage. It has

Attack skill.
Cost: Any amount up to your
Magery lever per second, for three seconds. The Acid Ball does 1d damage
per energy point.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 2 and Create
Acid.

Item
Staff or wand – the missile is fired
from the tip of the item. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 300.


Acid Jet
Regular
Shoot a jet of acid from one hand.
Each turn, the caster rolls against DX4 or Innate Attack skill to hit. The jet
may be dodged, but not parried or
blocked. The jet does knockback as
per Snow Jet; if the jet strikes the face,
the acid may blind the victim as
detailed on p. B428.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 3. Does 1d-1 of damage
for every point used. Range is equal to
the number of dice. Cost to maintain
is the same.
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Water Jet,
and Create Acid.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by
mages. The jet issues from the item’s
tip. Energy cost to create: 400.

Rain of Ice Daggers
Area
Ice Daggers rain from the sky onto
the area, causing 1d-2 impaling damage per second to all within it.
Characters and creatures under the
Rain of Ice Daggers take damage on
their own turns; if less than an entire
second is spent in the affected area,
damage is halved (round down).
The spell can only be cast out of
doors. Armor protects in the usual
fashion. A shield with a DB of 2 or better can be held overhead to block the
ice, but it may take damage (p. B484).
This requires two hands and a Ready
action, and succeeds automatically in
protecting the character once the
shield is readied upwards, but this
unreadies the shield from its normal
protective functions!
Inanimate objects such as
buildings protect with their DR.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1 (minimum 2). For double base cost, the Rain of Ice Daggers
does 1d per second!
Prerequisites: Magery 2, Hail, and
Ice Dagger.

Item
Staff. Usable only by mages. Cost to
create: 800 energy and a $1,000
sapphire.


Icy Breath (VH)
Regular
The caster expels a deadly hail of
ice and cold air from his mouth. The
caster rolls to hit against DX-4 or
Innate Attack skill. This counts as an
attack; it can be dodged or blocked,
but not parried. The caster must be
facing his target. No hand gestures are
required to cast this spell; certain lip
and tongue motions are made instead.
Thus, Icy Breath can be cast “no
hands” at any level of skill.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4. Does 1d+1 damage for
every point of energy in the spell.
Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Snow Jet,
and Resist Cold.

Item
Jewelry. Usable only by mages.

sapphire.

Jewelry. Usable only by mages.
Cost to create: 1,000 energy and a $500
carnelian.

Spit Acid (VH)
Regular
Similar to Acid Jet, except that the
acid issues from the caster’s mouth,
Spit Acid cannot be maintained, and
each energy point buys 1d damage
instead of 1d-1. Caster rolls to hit
against DX-2 or Innate Attack skill
(p. B201). This counts as an attack; it
may be dodged or blocked, but not
parried. The caster must be facing his
target. No hand gestures are required
to cast this spell; certain lip and
tongue motions are made instead.
Thus, Spit Acid can be cast “no hands”
at any level of skill.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 3, Acid Jet,
and Resist Acid.

Item
Jewelry. Usable only by mages.
Energy cost to create: 400.

Essential Acid (VH)
Regular
Turns regular acid into the magical
essence of acid. No substance is
immune to its bite, and it inflicts three
times as much damage before being
neutralized. Essential Water or Flame,
in like quantity, will nullify Essential
Acid. If frozen with the Freeze spell, it
is harmless until thawed.
At the GM’s option, this spell may
produce alkahest (p. 220).
Duration: Permanent until neutralized.
Cost: 8 per gallon.
Prerequisites: Magery 3 and all six
Acid spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 1,100.


Breathe Steam (VH)
Regular
Similar to Steam Jet, except that
the steam issues from the caster’s
mouth, Breathe Steam cannot be
maintained, and each energy point
buys 1d damage instead of 1d-1.
Caster rolls to hit against DX-2 or
Innate Attack skill. This counts as an
attack; it may be dodged or blocked,
but not parried. The caster must be
facing his target. No hand gestures are
required to cast this spell; certain lip
and tongue motions are made instead.
Thus, Breathe Steam can be cast “no
hands” at any level of skill.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4. Cannot be maintained.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisites: Magery 1, Steam Jet,
and Resist Fire.



Frost
Area
Creates a covering of frost on all
surfaces in the area of effect. The frost
is real, and lasts indefinitely if the temperature is below freezing. In warmer
conditions, the frost quickly melts to a
dew. When cast upon a real or magical
fire, the frost produces a cloud of
steam and causes the flames to hiss
for a few seconds. Only a tiny fire – a
match or candle – would actually be
extinguished by a Frost spell.
A Frost spell cast upon a fire elemental or other flaming creature does
one point of damage to the creature,
but is more likely to anger it than drive
it away.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: The frost lasts until it
melts naturally.
Base cost: 1.
Prerequisite: Create Water or Cold.


Predict Weather
Information
Forecasts the weather accurately
for a given location over a given time.
This forecast does not take magical
meddling into account, or predict the
actions of other wizards!
This is also an Air spell.
Cost: 2 times the length of the forecast, in days. Double the cost for a
location outside the general area (say,
over the horizon). Quadruple the cost
for a place on another continent. This
spell cannot predict weather on planets or planes other than the one where
the caster currently is.
Time to cast: 5 seconds per day
forecast.
Prerequisites: At least four Air
spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Cost to create: 200 energy, $350 blue gem.

Fog
Area
Creates an area of dense fog. Even
one yard of fog blocks vision. Flaming
weapons and missiles lose their extra
power in fog. A Fireball loses 1 point of
damage per yard of fog it must traverse
(e.g., a 3d Fireball that crosses 5 yards
of fog inflicts 3d-5 damage), while victims of an Explosive Fireball may
count each yard of fog as two yards of
distance from the blast. However, no
amount of fog will extinguish a fire.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to cast. Half that to
maintain.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.


Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 300.





Clouds
Area
Creates or dispels normal outdoor
cloud cover, as the caster chooses.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 10 minutes, after which
normal clouds leave or return unless
the spell is maintained.
Base cost: 1/20 (minimum 1). Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 10 seconds.
Prerequisites: At least two Water
spells and two Air spells.



Waves
Special; Area
Changes the surface calmness of
any large body of water. Each application of the spell can increase or
decrease the wave height by one point
on the Beaufort scale (above); to
achieve multiple-point changes, multiply the spell’s cost accordingly. The
wind is unaffected. Note that the
Beaufort scale is specific to ocean
waves; waves produced on lake shores
are generally much lower relative to
wind speed (GM’s judgment).
The spell may be cast on an area,
affecting the waves moving across it. It
can also be cast on an object, such as
a ship, which it must then encompass
in its entirety (typically, 10 to 30 yards
in radius). The area of effect then
moves with the object.
This is also a Water spell.

Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/60 (minimum 1). Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Shape Water.

Current
Special; Area
Affects the currents of any large
body of water. Each application of the
spell can shift the current direction by
22.5 degrees or speed by 1 mph (or
knot). To achieve combined direction/speed changes, or more extreme
changes in one or the other, increase
cost proportionately.
The spell may be cast on an area,
affecting the current moving under it
for 40 yards in depth. It can also be
cast on an object, such as a ship,
which it must then encompass in its
entirety. The area of effect then moves
with the object.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/50 (minimum 1). Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: At least six Water
spells.


Tide
Special; Area
Each application of this spell can
raise or lower the water level by one
foot; for larger changes, increase the
spell’s cost proportionately.
The “hill of water” thus created
spreads naturally from the area affected, dropping by one foot for each yard
beyond the actual area of the spell.
The spell may be cast on an area,
affecting the tide in it. It can also be
cast on an object, such as a ship,
which it must then encompass in its
entirety. The area of effect then moves
with the object.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/30 (minimum 1). Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisites: At least eight Water
spells.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 225.

Wind
Special; Area
Modifies the current outdoor wind
conditions. Each application of the spell
can shift the wind direction by 22.5
degrees (from W to WSW, for example),
or change wind speed by one level on
the Beaufort Scale (see box). To achieve
combined direction/speed changes, or
more extreme changes in one or the
other, increase cost proportionately.
The spell may be cast on an area,
affecting the wind moving over it from
the ground to an altitude of about 300
feet. It can also be cast on an object,
such as a sailing ship, which it must
then encompass in its entirety. The area
of effect then moves with the object.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/50 (minimum 1). Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Windstorm.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Energy cost
to create: 300.

Rain
Area
Creates (or prevents) 1 inch of rain
in a normal outdoor setting.
This is also an Air spell and a Water
spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/10 (minimum 1). Cost
to make rain doubles in a desert or
other area (GM’s determination) where
rain is unnatural. Cost to prevent rain
doubles in a naturally rainy or swampy
area. Same cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute.
Prerequisite: Clouds.

Item
Staff or wand. Usable only by a
mage. The item must be kept in water
when not in use; it loses its powers if it
stays dry for more than an hour.
Energy cost to create: 600.

Snow
Area
Creates (or prevents) 1 inch of snow,
in a normal outdoor setting. To work
properly, this spell must be cast when
the temperature is 32°F or lower. When
cast under warmer conditions, this
spell simply summons a thin drizzle,
dampening the ground but not leaving
any significant puddles.
This is also an Air spell and a Water
spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/15 (minimum 1). Each
additional 1/15 energy per yard radius
increases the amount of snow by 1
inch per hour. Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisites: Clouds and Frost.

Item
Staff. It must be kept cool when
not in use; it loses its powers if it is
exposed to temperatures over 90° for
more than two hours. Usable only by a
mage. Energy cost to create: 450.

Hail
Area
Makes hail fall. The temperature
must be above freezing. The main
effect is to provide intense distraction
to whoever is being pelted with hail;
wizards must make a Will roll each
second to keep their concentration.
For 5 times the cost, the GM may
allow really big hailstones, doing 1d-2
crushing damage per second.
This is also a Water spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 1/5 (minimum 1). For
damaging hailstones, base cost is 1.
Same cost to maintain.
Prerequisite: Snow.

Item
Staff. Usable only by a mage.
Energy cost to create: 500.

Warm
Area
Raises the ambient air temperature
of an area. This could be used to dissipate Fog, for example. The spell cannot raise the temperature above 100˚F.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Time to cast: 1 minute per base cost
application.
Base cost: 1/10 (minimum 1). Each base cost application raises the ambient temperature by 10˚F. Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Heat and at least four
Air spells.

Item
Staff. Usable only by a mage.
Energy cost to create: 150.

Cool
Area
Lowers the ambient air temperature of an area. This may cause fog to
appear if the conditions are right. The
spell cannot lower the temperature
below about -40˚F.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Time to cast: 1 minute per base cost
application.
Base cost: 1/10 (minimum 1). Each
base cost application lowers the ambient temperature by 10˚F. Same cost to
maintain.
Prerequisites: Cold and at least four
Air spells.

Item
Staff. Usable only by a mage.
Energy cost to create: 150.

Storm
Area
Creates (or dispels) a storm.
Depending on ambient temperature
and humidity, it may be a simple windstorm or include rain, snow or hail – the
odd lightning bolt, too. This is particularly effective at sea. The spell is unpredictable in its effects (which is to say the
GM decides what the storm does . . . ).
The spell can also be used to dispel
a storm; the effectiveness of the spell
depends on the relative sizes of the
affected area versus the natural
storm’s full area.
This is also an Air spell and a Water
spell.
Duration: 1 hour.
Base cost: 1/50 (minimum 1). Same
cost to maintain.
Time to cast: 1 minute. An incipient
storm will take about an hour to gather and reach full strength. Once the
spell lapses, it may take a varying
length of time to calm down – it may
even keep going on its own for hours
yet! A dispelled storm will also take
about an hour to calm down.
Prerequisites: Rain and Hail.

Item
Staff. Usable only by a mage.
Energy cost to create: 1,000.




Item

Cost to create: 1,000 energy and $1,000
in platinum. (b) Wand, staff, or jewelry. Cost to create: 1,500 energy and
$1,000 in platinum.

Lightning
Missile
Shoots a bolt of lightning from a
fingertip. This bolt has 1/2D 50, Max
100, Acc 3. Treat any metal armor as
DR 1 against this spell! If the target is
wounded, he must make a HT roll, at
-1 per 2 HP suffered, or be stunned.
He may attempt a HT roll each turn
thereafter to recover. Against electronic equipment, treat this attack as if it
had the Surge damage modifier (see
p. B105).
Lightning behaves unpredictably
around conductors. A lightning bolt
cannot be fired through a metal grid,
between bars, from within a car, etc. –
it jumps to the metal and is lost.
However, the GM may (for instance)
allow a wizard to shoot a lightning bolt
into a metal floor. This would not electrocute those on it, but could shock
them all, interrupting concentration
and doing slight damage (no more than
1 point, and possibly none at all). The
GM may encourage creative use of
lightning until it becomes a nuisance.
This is also an Air spell.
Cost: Any amount up to your
Magery level per second, for three seconds. The bolt does 1d-1 burning
damage per energy point.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds (the
caster’s fingers sparkle as the spell
builds).
Prerequisites: Magery 1 and at least
six other Air spells.


Lightning Whip
Regular
Creates a whip of lightning in the
caster’s hand. It is wielded like a normal
whip (p. B404), except that it always
takes only one second to ready, and it
cannot be used to parry or entangle. The
whip inflicts 1d burning damage every
time it strikes. The effects of lightning
damage listed under Lightning apply.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Cost: 1 to cast per two yards of
reach (maximum of 8 yards). Same to
maintain.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.
Prerequisite: Lightning.

Item
Glove, whip, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Energy cost to create: 350.


Item

Resist Lightning
Regular
The subject and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of lightning and electricity. In low-tech settings,
this is most often used to guard against
hostile magic; in higher-tech worlds, it
becomes a valuable professional tool.
This is also a Protection and
Warning spell and an Air spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 2 to cast. 1 to maintain.
Prerequisites: Any six Air spells.




Staff or wand – the bolt is fired
from the end of the item. Usable only

Missile
Creates a lightning bolt that affects
both its target and things nearby. This
has 1/2D 50, Max 100, Acc 3. It can be
thrown at a wall, floor, etc. (at +4 to
hit) to catch foes in the blast. The target and anyone closer to the target
than one yard takes full damage.
Those further away divide damage
by three times their distance in yards
from the explosion (round down). The
effects of lightning damage listed
under Lightning apply.
This is also an Air spell.
Cost: Any amount up to twice your
Magery level per second, for three seconds. The lightning bolt does 1d-1
burning damage per full 2 points of
energy.
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds.
Prerequisite: Lightning.

Staff or wand – the bolt is fired
from end of item. Usable only by a
mage. Energy cost to create: 1,200;
must include platinum decorations
worth $500.



Shocking Touch
Melee
Charges the caster’s hands or staff
with lightning. The caster must strike
the subject to trigger this spell; hit location is irrelevant. The subject takes
1d+1 burning damage per point of energy in the spell. Armor does not protect.
Shocking Touch has unusual side
effects on electronics and conductive
materials, as per Lightning (above).
This is also an Air spell.
Cost: 1 to 3.
Prerequisite: Lightning.

Item
Staff, wand, or glove. The item
must touch the subject. Energy cost to
create: 1,500.

Spark Cloud
Area
Creates a ground-level cloud of
electrical sparks. It does not block
vision, but it inflicts burning damage
to anyone standing in it. Armor protects in the usual fashion (metallic
armor provides the same minimal protection that it does against Lightning).
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 10 seconds.
Base cost: 1 to 5; the cloud inflicts 1
point of damage per second for every
point of energy put into the base cost.
Time to cast: 1 to 5 seconds, depending on base cost. Cannot be maintained.
Prerequisites: Shape Air and Lightning.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Cost to create: 150 energy,
$500 in platinum, and a $500 opal.

Spark Storm
Area
Creates a normal Windstorm, with
a dangerous addition: every turn
Lightning strikes one random victim
in the area of effect. To resolve the
bolt’s attack, roll against the caster’s
Spark Storm skill, without any range
adjustments. The victim gets an active
defense, as usual.
At the GM’s option, the lightning
strikes may not be completely random: tall targets may be at more risk
than short ones, and metal armor may
tend to attract the lightning. Mages
who use this spell know what the true
rules are in their world.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 minute after reaching
full strength.
Base cost: 2 (1d-1 Lightning), 4 (2d2 Lightning) or 6 (3d-3 Lightning) to
cast. Half that to maintain.
Time to cast: The storm starts
immediately, but the caster must concentrate for a number of seconds
equal to the storm’s radius in yards to
bring the storm to full strength.
Prerequisites: Windstorm and
Lightning.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Cost to create: 300 energy,
$500 in platinum ,and a $500 opal.



Wall of Lightning
Area
Creates a shimmering, crackling
curtain of lightning around an area.
The wall is four yards high, but may
be made higher by scaling the cost as
the height (double for 8 yards high,
triple for 12 yards high and so on).
Every turn, anyone crossing or
touching the wall suffers burning
damage. It impedes vision and hearing through it: -1 to these Sense rolls.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Base cost: 2 to 6 to cast. Same cost to
maintain. Each turn, the Wall inflicts
1d-1 burning damage for every two points of energy put into its base cost. Prerequisite: Lightning.

Ball of Lightning
Missile
Creates a ball of lightning in the
caster’s hand. Unlike a regular Missile
spell, however, a Ball of Lightning
floats away in the direction the caster
wills it to; it cannot be hurled in the
usual fashion. The ball is utterly silent
and moves in a straight line at a maximum speed equal to the caster’s skill
divided by 5 (round down), regardless
of wind and nonmetallic obstacles –
the ball floats right through windows,
curtains, walls, etc. It maintains its
heading and speed unless the caster
concentrates to change it. The ball
explodes on the mental command of
the caster or upon contact with a living being or metallic object. If the
spell is allowed to expire, the Ball
winks out of existence without
exploding.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: Any amount up to twice your
Magery level per second, for three seconds; half that to maintain. The ball
inflicts 1d-1 burning damage for every
2 full points of energy to anyone within 1 yard of the explosion. Those further away divide damage by three
times their distance in yards (round
down).
Time to cast: 1 to 3 seconds; the ball
grows in the caster’s hand as the casting progresses.
Prerequisites: Apportation and
Lightning.

Item
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Usable only
by mages. Cost to create: 600 energy
and a $500 opal.



Lightning Stare
Regular
The caster shoots lightning from
his eyes, using DX-4 or Innate Attack
skill to hit. The caster must be facing
the target to use this spell. The typical
ritual for this spell uses facial motions
rather than hand gestures; thus,
Lightning Stare can be cast “no
hands” at any level of skill.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 second.
Cost: 1 to 4. Cannot be maintained.
Does 1d burning damage per point of
energy put into the stare. Range is 2
yards per point of energy.
Time to cast: 2 seconds.

Lightning.

Jewelry. Usable only by mages.
Cost to create: 1,000 energy, $500
worth of platinum, and a $500 opal.

Prerequisites: Magery 2 and
Lightning.

(a) Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only
affects the wearer. A severe drawback is
that, as soon as it is activated, the item
falls through the user’s hand – thus a
spell cast with this item lasts only a
minute. Energy cost to create: 3,000. (b)
Staff, wand, or jewelry. Only affects the
wearer. Unlike the previous item, this
item turns to lightning along with the
wearer. While in lightning form, it loses
any other magical powers it might ordinarily have. Energy cost to create: 6,000.

Lightning Armor
Regular
The subject is sheathed in crackling lightning, without feeling any discomfort (the subject and anything he
carries are under a Resist Lightning
spell). The subject’s melee attacks do
an extra point of burning damage.
Any metallic weapon that hits the
subject triggers a 1d-1 backlash of
burning damage along the weapon.
This attack automatically hits the hand
that is holding the weapon, regardless
of the weapon’s length, as long as its
entire length is conducting. Should the
subject grapple or be grappled, the foe
takes 3d-3 burning damage, but the
spell will be broken.
This is also an Air spell.
Duration: 1 minute.
Cost: 7 to cast. 4 to maintain.
Prerequisites: At least six Lightning
spells including Resist Lightning.

(a) Staff or jewelry. Usable only by
mages. Cost to create: 1,000 energy
and $300 worth of platinum and

the wearer. When activated, the cape
seems like a piece of sheet lightning; it
will protect against attacks from the
back and sides, but not from the front,



Lightning Weapon
Regular
The subject melee weapon
becomes charged with lightning, visibly spitting and sparking, without
harming its wielder. The weapon must
be at least partly metallic; weapons
made entirely of wood and/or stone
won’t hold the spell. The weapon does
an additional 2 points of injury after
armor penetration and wounding
modifiers have been figured. Against
metallic armor, the weapon inflicts at
least 1 point of damage on any hit.
This is also an Air spell.

Regular
Like Lightning Weapon, but cast on
a missile weapon. The weapon itself
becomes surrounded with an electric
halo. Any missile it fires becomes
charged with lightning, doing 2 additional points of injury as per Lightning
Weapon. The missile’s wooden parts
turn to ash after it hits a target or after
10 seconds, whichever comes first.
This is also an Air spell.
